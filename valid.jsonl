{"text":"11efta pwns you","id":"29113","revision":"In the year 2018, Artemis, a town nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest, thrived on the electronic pulse of digital life. The city was a modern-day reflection of the rise and fall of Blomass, a once-dominant software company from the 90s and 00s, that had not only shaped the city's physical landscape but also its digital one.\n\nBlomass had transformed Artemis into a showcase of integrated city services and utility planning software, the beating heart of the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, time had not been kind to Blomass. Their bet on IoT had failed to pay off. Their glory days now behind them, they were acquired by Philmath, a dominant Dutch firm that prized Blomass more for their sales contracts than their innovative legacy.\n\nWith the Blomass product line left unsupported and the city unable to replace the legacy software, Artemis was left in a precarious digital state, a flaw soon exploited by a faceless antagonist who called themselves \"11efta.\"\n\n11efta, much like the hacker equivalent of a cat toying with a mouse before the kill, reveled in their newfound control. They manipulated the city's infrastructure at will - traffic lights blinked green en masse, electronic signs screamed, \"11efta pwns you\" - a constant reminder of the city's impotence.\n\nThe ransom demand was as much a shock to Artemis's system as the discovery of the hack - a daily tribute of 100 Bitcoins to keep the city's water and power running. With the city on the brink of bankruptcy and the specter of the last fiscal crisis still haunting Artemis, the demand was a death knell.\n\nThe city officials were forced to divert precious funds to meet 11efta's demands. Each payment, each siphoning of money from the budget, was a tightening of the noose. The sense of impending doom was palpable - every city service paid for with Bitcoin felt like a further plunge into the abyss.\n\nAs the city began to default on their municipal bond payments, Artemis's crisis rippled across Wall Street, drawing the ire of financiers who had once seen the city as a beacon of progress.\n\nIn this absurd crisis, the townspeople of Artemis found themselves facing an existential reckoning. They were not merely grappling with a rogue hacker but wrestling with the shadows of their past - the unchecked ambition of Blomass, the city's overreliance on technology, and their desperate financial straits.\n\nIn this grim tableau, the citizens began to exhibit an enduring spirit of humanism and solidarity. They found ways to persevere, clinging to a resilience borne out of necessity. Individuals offered each other support and began working towards a solution, recognizing that while they were victims of 11efta, they were also the only ones who could reclaim their city.\n\nYet, the lingering question remained: How does one fight an enemy that is but an echo in the digital wind? The narrative of Artemis had become a tale of technology’s promise turned into its curse, a symbol of the existential crisis of the digital age.\n\nAnd so, Artemis stood on the precipice, a city held hostage not just by 11efta, but by its own past. The story of Artemis serves as a stark reminder of our digital vulnerabilities, the threats of over-reliance on technology, and the unending struggle between human resilience and existential despair.\n\n= The Controller's Account =\n\n== Day 3: The Ugly Truth ==\n\nOn the third day of our crisis, the town hall of Artemis was packed with citizens, their faces reflecting a mix of fear, anger, and hope. The atmosphere was charged with the desperate need for a solution, any solution, to the stranglehold of 11efta. An emergency town meeting had been called, the first of its kind, to discuss an idea that had been making the rounds in the city – unplugging Artemis.\n\nAs the city controller, I was tasked with the unenviable job of presenting the truth to our citizens. I stood on the stage, looking out at the sea of faces, feeling the weight of their expectations. \"There has been talk,\" I began, my voice amplified in the silent hall, \"of a drastic solution. Unplugging Artemis.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement spread through the crowd. It seemed such a simple solution on the surface – unplug the city, disrupt 11efta's control, and break free. But as with many things in life, the reality was far more complicated and painful.\n\n\"Unplugging Artemis,\" I continued, \"is not an impossible task. But it would mean severing our city from the digital world, plunging us into a state akin to the pre-Internet era.\" I paused, letting the gravity of the situation sink in. \"It would mean cutting off access to online services, disrupting communication, halting commerce, and perhaps even shutting down essential utilities. It would be far more painful, more destructive, than living under 11efta's control and paying the daily tribute.\"\n\nThe hall fell silent, the initial surge of agreement replaced by a somber realization of the true cost of such an action. The thought of unplugging was a desperate grasp at autonomy, a reflexive desire to regain control. But at what cost?\n\nOur city had grown and thrived on the lifelines of digital connectivity, so deeply intertwined with our lives that severing those lines would be akin to cutting off a limb. The price of freedom, it seemed, was too steep to pay.\n\n\"We are exploring all possible options,\" I assured them, \"We will fight this crisis on all fronts, both digital and physical, to find a solution that doesn't involve such a drastic measure.\"\n\nThe meeting ended with a bitter pill to swallow. A collective understanding dawned - that we were not just facing an external enemy in the form of 11efta, but grappling with our own dependence on the digital infrastructure that defined our city.\n\nAs Day 3 drew to a close, we found ourselves facing not just a digital plague, but an existential one. A question that loomed over us all - could we bear to unplug Artemis and face the harsh realities of a disconnected life, or would we endure the suffocating grip of 11efta, clinging to the familiar, if disrupted, digital world we had built? The answer, as we would come to learn, would define us as a city, and as a community.\n\n== Day 8: The Faceless Adversary ==\n\nThe eighth day of our ordeal brought me face to face with our tormentor. A chat window on my screen was my only connection to 11efta. The city controller communicating with the faceless adversary who held our city hostage. It was an absurdly surreal situation, a digital showdown in a war of wits and codes.\n\nI typed, my fingers stiff with apprehension, \"What will it cost for you to relinquish admin controls over the Blomass orchestration suite?\"\n\nI hit 'enter', and the message disappeared into the void, destined for 11efta. The seconds ticked by as I waited for the response, my heart pounding in sync with the blinking cursor on the screen.\n\nAt last, the reply appeared. \"There is no number.\"\n\nI stared at the screen, perplexed by the response. Was it a bluff, a strategic move in this game of digital chess? Or was there another angle to this crisis that we had overlooked?\n\nI typed again, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe response was immediate this time. \"This is a social experiment, not a financial ransom.\"\n\nThe implications of those words hit me like a physical blow. The daily tribute, the disruption of our city's services, the relentless control over our infrastructure - it was all a game to 11efta. A twisted, perverse experiment in power and control.\n\n11efta’s next message drove the point home. \"The joy of seeing the city squirm far exceeds any financial gain you could provide.\"\n\nDay 8 stripped away the illusion that this was a simple ransomware attack. It was a sadistic spectacle for 11efta, a demonstration of power over a helpless city, an amusement in the theatre of digital chaos.\n\nAs I sat back in my chair, the cold realization settling in, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. We were caught in a game we didn't understand, pawns in a grand social experiment. It wasn't just about money or control, it was about the perverse joy our tormentor derived from our suffering. Our enemy was not just a hacker but a sociopath, revelling in the power of his anonymity and the fear that he wielded like a weapon.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, I couldn't help but reflect on the magnitude of our situation. The ransomware attack had transformed into a test of our resilience, our unity, and our humanity. The battle lines were drawn not in code, but in the hearts and minds of the people of Artemis. It was a test we could not afford to fail.\n\n== Day 11: A City Spurned ==\n\nDay 11 of the crisis held a different kind of ordeal for the beleaguered city of Artemis - a political one. I found myself, as the city controller, accompanied by the Mayor and a handful of city council members on a journey to the governor's office. Our mission was a plea for aid, for some kind of intervention to liberate our city from the invisible chains of 11efta.\n\nThe Governor, a staunch Republican with a reputation for his less-than-amicable relationship with Artemis's liberal progressive government, had agreed to meet us. A glimmer of hope had flickered in the city's heart. Perhaps this was the moment when political differences could be set aside for the common good.\n\nThe Governor's office was grand, a stark contrast to the digital chaos back home. As we entered the room, the air seemed to tighten, a palpable tension clinging to the lavish drapes and polished mahogany.\n\n\"Artemis has always been a symbol of the blue wave, hasn't it?\" the Governor began, his voice echoing in the high-ceilinged room. His tone was not hostile but held a note of mocking curiosity. He continued, \"A shining example of progressive ideals... yet here you are, asking for aid from a red administration.\"\n\nWe tried to steer the conversation towards the issue at hand - the ransomware crisis - explaining the severity of the situation. But our pleas fell on deaf ears. Instead, the Governor used the meeting as a platform to criticize our city's politics and policies.\n\n\"Our administration cannot justify diverting state funds to bail out a city that prioritizes ideology over practicality,\" he said, his words leaving no room for negotiation. The governor's refusal to help was not just a decision; it was a calculated political move. He intended to use Artemis's crisis as a chilling reminder to other liberal-leaning cities of the cost of going against his administration.\n\nHis message was clear: Artemis's plight was a consequence of its progressive governance and digital overdependence, a cautionary tale to the rest of the state.\n\nAs we left the governor's office, the crushing weight of his words hung in the silence between us. The door closed behind us, shutting us out of the world of political power plays and back into the cold grip of our ransomware crisis.\n\nOur hope for state aid was dashed, replaced by a renewed sense of urgency. We were on our own, thrown back into the digital battlefield against an enemy that seemed all the more formidable. It wasn't just the grip of 11efta that we had to break, but the isolating political divide that had left our city to fend for itself.\n\n== Day 16: A Controller's Dilemma ==\n\nDay 16 found me staring at the grating spinning wheel of buffering on my home computer screen, the symbol of 11efta’s throttling grip on our city’s internet service. It was a sight that, only a few weeks ago, would have been merely frustrating, but now held profound implications for my children's future.\n\nMy children, both bright young adults, were halfway through their degrees at a for-profit online university. They were eager and ambitious, willing to shoulder the burden of student loans to achieve their dreams. However, dreams have a habit of coming undone during a crisis.\n\nThe persistently hampered connectivity had rendered their participation in online classes practically impossible. Their educational pursuits were at a standstill, their dreams locked behind a paywall of Bitcoins we could not afford. The question that haunted my sleepless nights was this - how could I, as a father, let their dreams be another casualty of this digital plague?\n\nTherein lay an offer, an illicit whisper in the city's underbelly - the black market WiFi. A clandestine operation that offered a bypass around 11efta's control, a gateway to the world beyond Artemis's digital prison. It was a tempting proposition, a father's potential solution to his children's predicament.\n\nYet, I was torn.\n\nAs the city controller, I bore a responsibility towards Artemis, a duty to share in its suffering. Was it not a betrayal, to secure a private lifeline while the city's digital lifeblood was slowly being drained away? To allow my family to circumvent the crisis that was crushing the rest of our community? Was this not a form of surrender to the same terror that we, as a city, were fighting against?\n\nOn the other hand, as a father, my primary obligation was to my children, to ensure their future wasn't collateral damage in this ransomware war. The weight of their student loans hung over our heads, a ticking clock counting down to financial ruin if they failed to complete their credits on time.\n\nThis internal conflict seemed to embody the essence of our crisis - an interplay between the personal and the communal, a reckoning with the absurdity of our situation. An existentialist might have seen in it an echo of Camus' philosophy, an absurd universe indifferent to our struggles, forcing us to confront the meaning we derive from our existence.\n\nI found myself standing on the precipice of a profound decision. Would I choose duty over familial love, the collective over the individual? Or would I defy my position and embrace the human instinct to protect my own?\n\nIn the depths of my contemplation, I was reminded of a line from Camus, \"In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.\" Amid the digital winter of Artemis, I realized that my decision, whatever it may be, would not merely be a surrender to the absurdity of our situation but a reaffirmation of the resilient human spirit that lay within us all, a spark of defiance in the face of despair.\n\nAnd so, under the indifferent gaze of the spinning wheel on my computer screen, I grappled with my dual roles as a city official and a father, reflecting on the essential absurdity of our existence in this besieged city, my every thought a ripple in the existential pool of our crisis.\n\n== Day 23: A Reckoning with Wall Street ==\n\nThe twenty-third day of the crisis was a confrontation with Wall Street. The conference room felt more like an arena as I, as the city controller, squared off against the unblinking eyes of our city's bondholders.\n\nI opened the meeting with the harsh truth. \"If the situation continues,\" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil within, \"Artemis may miss its upcoming bond payments.\" There was an audible intake of breath from the attendees. It was an unprecedented statement, a shockwave in our financial landscape, but it was also a reality we could no longer ignore.\n\nThe bondholders were understandably upset. Their investments in Artemis were tied to the promise of the city's growth and prosperity, a promise now marred by the ransomware attack. They demanded assurances, timelines, contingency plans - the standard panacea for financial distress. Yet, how could I promise certainty in the face of the uncertainties that had become the lifeblood of our city?\n\nOne bondholder, a seasoned investor with a hawk-like gaze, leaned forward. \"You have a responsibility to us,\" he stated, \"We won't allow our investments to be squandered because of a software glitch.\"\n\n\"A software glitch?\" I echoed, the understatement hitting me like a physical blow. Was this how they perceived our crisis, reduced it to a mere glitch? How could I make them understand that this was not just a financial crisis, but a matter of survival for our city?\n\n\"This is more than just a glitch,\" I replied. \"It's a stranglehold on our city's lifelines. It’s not just about money; it's about people's lives.\" I could see their skepticism, their dismissal of the existential threat that 11efta posed. They lived in a world of ledgers and balance sheets, insulated from the harsh realities of a city under siege.\n\nI could offer them no miracles, no swift solutions. I spoke instead of our plans to keep the city functioning, of our continuous search for a resolution to the ransomware crisis, and our commitment to honor our debts as soon as we could. It was a bleak picture, but an honest one.\n\nThe meeting concluded on a note of uneasy tension. The investors left with more questions than answers, their faith in our city shaken. I was left to contemplate the widening chasm between the financial world and the realities of our crisis. The conversation with Wall Street was a stark reminder of the different battles we were fighting – one against a digital plague, the other against the relentless demands of capital.\n\nAs I returned to my office, the city lights flickered outside my window, a silent testament to the ongoing struggle. Day 23 closed with the sobering reality of our financial predicament. The battle for Artemis was not just in the code-infested digital realm but also in the hard, uncompromising world of finance. A battle that we had to fight, for the sake of the city that we loved.\n\n== Day 27: The Unseen Battlefield ==\n\nThe twenty-seventh day of the crisis brought the long-awaited call from Washington. As city controller, I had reached out to our senator weeks ago, pleading for federal intervention, for someone to hear our plight. Today, finally, the White House responded.\n\nThe person on the other end of the call was not our senator but an undersecretary in the Department of Homeland Security, a middleman in the labyrinth of Washington bureaucracy. There was a distant coolness in his voice, a clinical detachment as he confirmed my worst fears.\n\n\"11efta,\" he informed me, \"is not your everyday hacker. It's a state-supported actor.\"\n\nI sat in stunned silence. A state-supported actor? The ransomware crisis, the torment of our city, was part of a larger geopolitical chess game? The revelation was a blow, sending waves of dread through me.\n\n\"We are in a silent war,\" the undersecretary continued, \"a war fought not on battlefields, but in codes and systems, in data streams and servers. Your city's crisis... it's a skirmish in this larger conflict.\"\n\nHis words were a chilling reminder of the vast, shadowy landscape of cyber warfare, a battlefield where cities like Artemis could become casualties without a shot being fired.\n\nI found my voice, hoarse with desperation. \"So what happens to us? What happens to Artemis?\"\n\nThere was a pause before he responded. \"The Administration cannot show weakness or negotiate in this war. I'm sorry, but for now, Artemis is on its own.\"\n\nAbandoned. Left to fend for ourselves while power games played out in digital arenas we could barely comprehend. The words hung heavy in the air, a stark testament to the grim reality we faced.\n\nAs I hung up the phone, a deep sense of isolation settled in. We had been abandoned by our country, left to navigate this crisis on our own. The realization was a bitter pill to swallow, made even more painful by the knowledge that we were mere pawns in a much larger game.\n\nAs Day 27 closed, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of powerlessness. The machinations of power were unfolding on levels removed from our understanding, making our city's struggle seem insignificant. Yet, for the people of Artemis, this wasn't just a game of codes and state actors, it was our lives, our homes, our city.\n\nIn the face of such abandonment, we had no choice but to band together, to stand firm, and to fight for our city. For as long as it took.\n\n== Day 32: A Controller's Descent ==\n\nThe thirty-second day dawned with a heaviness that seemed to choke the very air I breathed. I woke up, as always, at 6 a.m., before the sun's rays could cast light on the digital carnage left in the wake of 11efta.\n\nAs the city controller of Artemis, I was caught in a brutal bind. Each day was a frantic race against time, a desperate scramble to scrape together the daily tribute of 100 Bitcoins. My every decision felt like a pact with the devil, a zero-sum game in which every choice was a sacrifice.\n\nThe first thing I did that day was to check the city's dwindling coffers. The figures were a stark reminder of our predicament - we were on borrowed time, every tick of the clock a step closer to complete financial ruin.\n\nI moved to the next painful task. Cancelling another community project to divert the funds to 11efta's tribute. A new library that had been the talk of the town. 'Education for everyone,' the Mayor had promised during the groundbreaking. Now it was just another casualty in our war against the digital plague.\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur of conference calls with increasingly irate Wall Street creditors, tense meetings with city council members, and disheartening budget assessments. My every conversation was punctuated with pleas and half-promises, trying to buy just a little more time.\n\nThe public protests against the government were growing louder and more frequent. The citizens of Artemis felt betrayed, and rightly so. Yet, what could I tell them? That the ghost in our machines demanded a price we couldn't afford to pay? That their city was held hostage by a hacker whose name had become a curse on our lips?\n\nBy mid-afternoon, we were still short of the tribute. In a moment of desperation, I took the most drastic measure yet - authorizing the sale of a public park, one of the last remaining green lungs in Artemis, to a real estate developer. As I signed the papers, I felt a part of the city's soul being ripped away, but the choice was stark - pay the tribute or plunge the city into darkness.\n\nThe clock struck 6 p.m., and the tribute was paid, just in time. But as the digital transfer completed, my relief was tainted with the bitter taste of defeat. The city was still running, but at what cost?\n\nAs I looked out of my office window at the fading light, I felt a sense of loneliness envelop me. The city was quieter than it used to be, the silent streets a grim reminder of our predicament. The street signs flickered, \"11efta pwns you,\" a mocking echo in the darkening night.\n\nDay 32 ended like the ones before, leaving me feeling more like a ransom negotiator than a city controller. The dread of the tribute hung over me, a constant reminder of the existential crisis we were facing. The question wasn't just how much longer we could keep paying, but how much more we could lose before there was nothing left of Artemis but a husk, a ghost town powered by a digital specter.\n\n== Day 36: Lights Out ==\n\nDay 36 was the darkest yet, literally and metaphorically. It was the day the lights went out in Artemis.\n\n11efta, it seemed, had another trick up their sleeve. They targeted the centralized exchange we used to make our Bitcoin payments. A merciless Distributed Denial of Service attack, and just like that, our lifeline to our digital tormentor was severed.\n\nWe missed the daily tribute. As the sun set, so did our hopes. The lights in Artemis flickered, then went out.\n\nI stood by my office window, gazing out at the darkened cityscape. The silence was unsettling, a stark reminder of the power 11efta held over us.\n\nAnd then, in the dead of the night, a worse disaster struck. Our hospital's backup generator, our lifeline in the dark, failed. The primary tank was empty, and the secondary tank, filled with stale diesel and water, proved unusable.\n\nTwo patients died that night. Their ventilators shut off, and despite the best efforts of our medical staff, they couldn't be saved. Two lives extinguished, just like the lights of our city.\n\nRage and impotence surged within me, an infernal cocktail of emotions. My hands were shaking, not with fear, but with an existential anger, a defiance against the absurdity of our situation.\n\nWe were pawns in a game we didn't sign up for, victims of a crisis we didn't cause, and yet we were the ones paying the price. The city I was responsible for was crumbling, its people suffering, and there was nothing I could do.\n\nAs I sat alone in the dark, the weight of our circumstances threatened to crush me. I was on the edge of an abyss, staring into the void of a black absurdity. Our fight against 11efta had become a fight against the senseless cruelty of existence, a testament to the human capacity for endurance in the face of despair.\n\nDay 36 was a testament to our struggle, a bitter monument to our fight. We were caught in a tempest of uncertainty and terror, every day bringing a new challenge. But as the city controller, I had no choice but to persevere. I was the captain of a sinking ship, and I would be damned if I let it go down without a fight.\n\nThe lights were out in Artemis, but we would not be extinguished. We would endure, as we always had, in defiance of the absurdity that sought to break us. This was our city, and we would not go gentle into that good night. We would rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n== Day 43: The Exodus Question ==\n\nDay 43 greeted us with an ominous message from our tormentor: \"You best be leaving.\"\n\nThe cold, electronic script of 11efta's message echoed throughout the silent chambers of City Hall, casting a chilling pall over the assembly. Was it a threat? A warning? Or merely another move in this sickening game?\n\nA debate ensued, unlike any other in the history of Artemis. The question was as simple as it was horrifying: should we evacuate our city?\n\nVoices rose and fell in the hall, a tempest of opinions, fears, and frustrations. The mayor advocated for evacuation, arguing it was our duty to protect our citizens. Some council members echoed his sentiment, their faces pale with fear, their voices shaking with emotion.\n\nBut others vehemently opposed the idea. To evacuate was to admit defeat, to abandon our homes, our lives, our city. It was a bitter pill to swallow, one that tasted of betrayal and defeat.\n\nAs city controller, I listened, my heart heavy in my chest. I understood both sides. The safety of our citizens was paramount, but to abandon Artemis, to concede to 11efta, felt like a blow to our spirit, to our resolve.\n\nIn the end, no decision was made. We were too divided, too caught up in our own fears and stubborn pride. As night fell on the city, the echoes of our arguments still rang in the empty hall. The question remained unanswered, an ugly specter hanging over us.\n\nDay 43 ended in uncertainty and dread. \"You best be leaving,\" 11efta's message seemed to mock us in the silence, a haunting reminder of our powerlessness. Yet, in the heart of every Artemis citizen, there was a spark of resilience, a determination that would not be extinguished. We were Artemis, and we would fight, whether it was against a faceless hacker, or against the existential dread gnawing at our hearts.\n\nTomorrow, the debate would continue. Tomorrow, we would face the question again: Should we stay, or should we go? But for tonight, in the silent darkness of our city, we were all just weary soldiers in an unseen war, holding on to the one thing 11efta couldn't take from us: hope.\n\n== Day 69: The Twisted Path ==\n\nDay 69 arrived with a glimmer of hope, a hope stained by the grimy fingerprints of Wall Street.\n\nIt was a call from a suave bond salesman, an eager voice, all honey and optimism, offering us a way out. His offer was a twisted salvation, a lifeline woven from barbed wire: Wall Street had been in contact with 11efta.\n\n\"For 6900 Bitcoins,\" he said, \"he will relinquish control of Artemis.\"\n\nI could barely breathe as the number sank in. It was an astronomical sum, a king's ransom. But then came the sting in the tail.\n\n\"In addition,\" he continued, his voice bright as a neon sign, \"we will back a bond issuance to pay the ransom... on one condition. You must replace the obsolete Blomass software with Philmath's new Secure City package.\"\n\n\"Cost?\" I managed to croak, already anticipating the answer.\n\n\"An additional 250 million,\" he replied nonchalantly. As if it were pocket change.\n\nIt was absurd. Blackmail atop blackmail. A sinister, spiraling carousel of monetary and moral compromise. Yet in the dark caverns of our crisis, no other light seemed to flicker. The existential conundrum was almost laughable, were it not so heart-wrenching.\n\nYet, I couldn't shake off the implications of this new bond. Our city was already reeling from its existing fiscal crises. To take on this additional burden... I saw the future in stark, black and white hues - years of crippling debt, public services being cut, generations bearing the brunt of today's crisis.\n\nDespite the pressure, I voiced my concerns. The bond salesman’s response came cool, aloof, and threatening.\n\n\"Your only way out, Controller, is through.\"\n\nI stared at the phone long after the call ended. The sheer audacity of his words rattled me. Yet, deep down, I knew we were cornered. The only way out was indeed through, through a twisted path laden with moral and financial pitfalls.\n\nDay 69 ended not with a resounding solution, but with the bitter aftertaste of a cruel compromise. We were at the mercy of merciless actors, each playing their own power games at the expense of Artemis and its people.\n\nYet, if this was our only way out, then we would have to take it. After all, in the face of absurdity, the only real freedom was the freedom to choose our path, no matter how treacherous it may be.\n\n[[Category:Storyline]]\n[[Category:2018]]\n      fyxttzni7nokjsqy9l4leawk090peed\n    "}
{"text":"About Starholder","id":"1013","revision":"Starholder is a worldbuilding project in search of its founding text. It is an exploration of networked media and the new forms it enables. We start with the word. It acts as the founding source code from which everything else is rendered upon. \n\n== Background ==\n\nThe conceit behind Starholder is that in 1999, rampant techno-anxiety triggered by the Y2K bug results in a new timeline emerging. The [[Timeline Chronology|Starholder Timeline]] barely diverges from our reality at first, but as time goes on, things get weirder, and the drift accelerates until this new world is almost unrecognizable as originating from our own.\n\nThere are laws, physics and lore behind the origin and operation of the Timeline. You can find that on the [[Timeline Properties]] page. What one needs to know is that the timeline acts as a buffer system in which the unbearable and destabilizing excesses of late capitalism and techno-accelerationsim are shunted off into Starholder to keep our reality from crashing. This new world is disposable, and its purpose is to take in all the trash that would destroy ours. \n\nThese butterfly effects compound, pushing divergence further as each new one is overlaid on the last. As a consequence, the Starholder Timeline lives the future faster, harder and is forced to confront events that reorient humankind on a far too frequent basis. Chaos abounds, but naïve techno optimism drives its inhabitants because bleak dystopias are played out and boring.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Timeline covers one hundred years of imagined history, from 1999 to 2099 broken into five periods. Each is an exploration of a technological package and its effect on society & culture.\n\n* The End Of History (1999 - 2016)\n* Networked Life Intensifies (2017 - 2033)\n* The Great Disruption (2034 - 2051)\n* We Are Not Alone (2052 - 2079)\n* The Impending Collapse (2080 – 2099)\nThe goal of the project is to tell the stories of each period and weave them together into a larger overarching narrative capable of delivering meaning while also hitting people in the feels. Starholder takes a bottom-up approach to worldbuilding, using stories, characters, places, and things as scaffolding with an expectation that over time a grand narrative emerges on top of it.\n\nIt starts with text as the foundation, but it is text that is meant to be rendered up continually over time into new forms of networked media. Think of the words as the substrate on which the world is built and then rebuilt, authored by humans and AI. Starholder is as much a fictional timeline as it is a training model for future creation.\n\n== Objectives ==\n\nThe objective of the timeline is twofold: \n\n# Render up a 100 year fictional history that becomes an important myth within our culture.\n# Create a historical arc that does not end in failure and collapse upon itself in its year 2099.\n\nThese objectives operate on two levels: \n\n* Can Starholder capture the necessary attention of others to see the timeline built out and its story told to completion in a way that achieves cultural importance?\n* Deliver a satisfying ending where the Starholder Timeline overcomes the odds of failing and finds a viable alternative to the dystopias assumed by late-stage capitalism. Can we fulfill our debt to our audience by saving Starholder from its planned destruction?\n      lhqatapsud93cm88haxvt3jdetx6ig1\n    "}
{"text":"Above The Clouds","id":"28942","revision":"Above The Clouds is a novella in the YA genre that follows the story of [[Kara]] and Jin as they escape their life in the gas fisher fleet and disappear into the grasslands on a quest to meet Starholder and ascend above the clouds. \n\nThe work is notable in that it was published in 2043, eight years ahead of the appearance of the [[Second Moon]]. It is considered by some to be a prophetic piece, a warning to the people of Earth about the looming dangers they were facing. Others viewed it as an inside job, and that the story was published to signal to plants on Earth to begin their preparations for the coming of the Second Moon. \n\nThe story is a work in progress which needs to be rendered into existence as the Starholder Timeline fills out, and serves as an important prequel to the Second Moon Storyline. \n\nChapters 1 through 3 are human written by Damien Dojoz and serve as the voice and model for future chapters. Those are considered largely plot complete and serve as a solid foundation for the ongoing story.\n\nChapters 4 through 6 are in draft form and a work in progress. They were produced with ChatGPT early in its release cycle using the GPT-3 model. The storyline, events and tone are not quite there and it is questionable whether they will serve as ongoing scaffolding or be replaced when work on the novella resumes.\n\n== Novella Chapters ==\n[[Above The Clouds - Chapter 1|Chapter 1 - Ascent]]\n\n[[Above The Clouds - Chapter 2|Chapter 2 - Someday]]\n\n[[Above The Clouds - Chapter 3|Chapter 3 - A Meeting With Guildfather]]\n[[Category:Above The Clouds]]\n[[Category:Storyline]]\n[[Category:2043]]\n      jls21vtx6o0sj6dtctf6zvhqerkgbhq\n    "}
{"text":"Above The Clouds - Chapter 1","id":"28943","revision":"==Ascent==\n\nFaithful Jin pads his way across the camp to the balloonists’ quarters. He pushes strips of hanging door aside, feeling the cascade of scales scitter-scatter across his arm. A half dozen boys sleep huddled together inside. He pauses for a moment and when none stir, he steps into the oblong hut. Walking with soft feet, his hands reach out in the dim light for the dividing wall. Finding it, he walks sideways until he finds the second hanging door. He stops and brings his palms and fingers together. They are mirror images of each other as he is a mirror image of the sleeping boys.\n\nThe hanging scales part in the center and Jin peeks his head inside. The room is filled with the snoring slumber of eight girls. He runs his eyes over their blanket-covered bodies and sets about how to find Kara within this tangled tumble. He’s never snuck into the balloonist’s hut before, never faced the problem of waking one without waking all.\n \nWhich one is Kara?\n\nAfter a moment, a solution comes to Jin. He creeps into the room and pulls back the bottom of each blanket, exposing feet hanging off their shared mattress. A faint sparkle catches his eye, and he stops at the third set of toes. Kneeling down, Jin looks closely. They are green, purple, iridescent even in the dark. Yesterday, in the idle hours aloft, the two gathered up dead shake beetles from the bottom of the balloon, husked their shells and crushed them into a pigment. While Jin scanned the clouds, Kara went about the business of painting her toenails.\n\nHis fingers curl around her left foot. He presses his thumb into the calloused underside of her big toe. He squeezes once, twice, three times. He waits for her to stir. When she doesn’t, he repeats the pattern over and over until a half-hearted kick stops him. Kara is up, her eyes still dull with sleep, her brown hair frizzed out in all directions. She recognizes Jin at the end of her bed, signals for him to be quiet, and then points him out of the hut.\n \nThey pull hoods over their heads and walk away from the dreaming world of camp kids. It is the pre-dawn hour, the time of the early workers who are readying the camp. Soon hundreds will flood from their beds and set about the business of launching the mighty gas fisher fleet.\n \nJin leads them out of the warren of huts to a group of people on the edge of camp. Dozens of cloaked children huddle around a bonfire in the frosty morning. They await the arrival of the grassland caravan carrying today’s bundles of fuel. These kids are all stove tenders tasked with stoking the clay ovens whose fires feed the camp and whose smoke fills the great fishing balloons.\n\nShake beetles buzz about the blaze, savoring the heat on a chilly morn. Kara and Jin do not speak. Doing so could reveal their presence to Edda and Lonni, the stove tenders assigned to their balloon. They are somewhere in this group, indistinguishable in appearance, but recognizable in voice.\n \nKara and Jin dance through the crowd, stand with heads bowed on the edge of conversations listening. Edda’s voice cracks and cackles when she’s excited. Lonni speaks in a low, slow tone and answers “Ya think?” to most things he hears. It is Jin who finds them. The boy’s senses are sharp, and he can tune out distractions. He points them out to Kara. She sneaks behind them and blows a cloud of the iridescent beetle shell pigment on each one’s shoulder. It will be easier to avoid them now.\n \nThe caravan approaches. Dozens of men and women stooped low from huge sacks on their back materialize out of the void. They’ve walked miles overnight carrying pellets of dried grass, brush, and dung which will be burnt in the stoves. They come from the edge of the valley near the gaslands. These are infrequent visitors from very far out. Their arrival is the reason Jin woke Kara. Someone special lives among them and Kara wants to get a message out.\n\nAfter greetings, bundles are shifted from one group to the other. What a single elder can carry for miles, takes two children to bring inside the camp. As Edda and Lonni load up, Kara points at water buckets. Jin nods, picks up a pair of pails and the two circulate amongst the tired traders.\n\nA woman sits on a rock far from the fire chatting with others. She has two satchels crisscrossing her chest. Long crimson earrings hang from her ears, they reflect traces of light in the shadows. She is different from the rest, the center of attention. Kara starts out towards her, Jin stumbles after, water spilling from his buckets.\n\nKara scoops a cup of water from Jin’s pail and offers it to her. The woman takes it, thanks her with a big smile and then drinks with a steady hand. \n\n“It’s unusual for a camp kid to decorate themselves,” she says, tapping Kara’s toe with her own.\n\n“There was no fish, no wind yesterday,” Kara answers.\n\n“Cloud dead.”\n\nKara looks at the woman in surprise. “You’ve been aloft?”\n\n“No. I’ve just heard the term. I’m Toni.”\n\nShe holds her hand out, fingers covered in rings like a townswoman. Kara shakes it, bends a bit at the knee. \n\n“I’m Kara and this here is Jin. You’re not like the other people.”\n\n“I do a different business than them, but I live in the grasses like they do.”\n\n“More than that. You decorate yourself.”\n\n“Advertising dear.”\n\nToni takes the satchels off her shoulders, places them on the ground. She reaches into the larger woven one and pulls out a radiant necklace made up of three rows of dragonfish scales that taper into a triangle.\n\n“I make jewelry. This piece is for a client in town.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“I can’t say.”\n\n“No need to. I’ve only ever seen something that fancy on a guildmother.”\n\n“Thank you for the water Kara and Jin. It was nice meeting you.”\n\nKara looks up, her face flush. Was this woman dismissing her? Had she said the wrong thing? Jin reaches down for his pails, but Kara stops him.\n\n“Toni, it seems like you know many people. I was hoping to get a message out.”\n\n“To whom?” she asks.\n\n“The camp still remembers Starholder. I’d like to meet him.”\n\n“You would be disappointed to meet him.”\n\n“So, you know him!”\n\nToni laughs, to her Starholder is just a man among the grasses.\n \n“Of course, we all do. He’s a dung collector. Spends his days in the gaslands picking up fish poo for the pellets. Why do you want to meet him?”\n\n“Because he’s been carried away. He’s been [[Above The Clouds|above the clouds]]. I want to know what is up there.”\n\n“What have they told you?”\n\n“There’s only trouble [[Above The Clouds|above the clouds]].”\n\nKara looks into the sky. There are no clouds, there is only the cloud, the ever present, all-encompassing cloud that blocks the heavens and hides the great schools of fish from view.\n\n“They are not wrong. It only brought trouble to Starholder. Thank you for the water. I must be going to town now if I want to reconnect with the caravan on the way back.”\n\n“Wait please. Will you carry my message?”\n\n“As repayment for the water.”\n\n“I want to follow him above the clouds again.”\n\n“I will tell him that there is a girl in the gas fisher camp who paints her toes, falls upwards, and dreams of the world above the clouds. He’ll be happy to know he is remembered, but don’t get carried away. His eyes are on the ground now, not up in the sky.”\n\n“Thank you, Toni.”\n\nThey part ways. Toni setting off in the direction of town, almost an hour away. Kara and Jin turn back to camp. Daybreak is creeping across the land, burying the shadows of the night. At a crossroads, they turn onto the hard-packed road that runs from the camp out to the edge of the grasses. They are joined by others, the road filling with the business of camp, sleepy eyed kids on their way to their stations hoping that their stove is already lit, that someone has warmed the porridge, put a few cooked fish on the communal slab.\n\nThe morning is still, there’s no breeze and the sharp smell of pellet-burn hangs in the air. They pass Station One on the right side of the road. Station Two is on the left two hundred twenty yards from them. The alternating pattern repeats for three miles. They are assigned to Station Eight, the midway point of the fleet. Kids run past them, but Kara and Jin are in no hurry. There’s nothing they can do until their balloon, connected to the stove by a long trench in the ground, fills with hot air and is ready to take flight.\n \nJin keeps his eyes on the clouds as he walks. He studies eddies and ripples within the omnipresent cover. They are currents which funnel and concentrate insects the little fish feed on. He’s only ten years old, but he sees things that others cannot. He has a gift for when the fish are close above, when to open the shake bug traps and lure their prey down from the hidden safety above.\n \n“The clouds are going to give today,” he says. “The gutters will work until they are sore. Guildfather will be happy. Perhaps he will give us sweets.”\n\n“I’ve not seen him in days. Is he even here to give us sweets?”\n\n“Where else would he be?”\n\n“In town, living well off of our labor.”\n\n“There will be so many fish today that he will appear from wherever he is. He’ll have those fat happy eyes and call us all his darling chicks.”\n\n“What do you see Jin?”\n\n“I see a rolling. The cloud bottom is not flat like usual. There’s an enormous school pushing down as they pass. Perhaps a large enough school to attract the dragonfish.”\n\nKara looks at Jin and tussles the boy’s hair. This morning’s talk of Starholder has him worked up. No one has seen a dragonfish in camp since Starholder was cast out years back. Guildfather’s shimmer balloon is the kids’ only proof that they are even real. To see that balloon aloft, dragonfish scales reflecting ruby red over the land, is to marvel that such creatures live above them and to wonder what other magic exists among the clouds.\n\n“If today is going to give us a dragonfish, then we need to hurry to our station and help get things ready. We’ll need to tell Lonni and Edda to build the fire strong and fill the balloon tight so that it can hold all the fish we catch in our nets. I don’t want to be pulled back to the ground because there’s not enough air in the envelope.”\n\nKara walks faster, and Jin breaks into a jog to stay a step ahead of her. Everything is a competition between them. It makes the day go faster, sharpens Jin. He’s marked to be a pilot one day, when he’s grown enough to handle the sandbags that control the height of the balloon.\nBehind the ovens, the oldest, largest kids work to pull the enormous canvas balloons from their storage sheds. They unfold them and stretch them out until they are flat on the dirt. Next, they take large poles and lift the bottom section of the balloon envelope off the ground. This is hard work, unappreciated, but taking as much skill as Kara’s command of the gondola. Once raised, they tug and shake the canvas giving it shape and room for hot air to enter. At last the balloon is ready for inflation and they attach the long exhaust pipe from the stove. \n\nKara feels a buzz from the early morning rhythm of camp. She is connected to a community. She is connected to the land. She is right with the place assigned to her. All of that changes aloft. There up in the gondola, she wrestles with impulses and thoughts she does not quite understand. Up in the sky, a voice tells her to cut the tether rope and float away. It is strong and persistent, whispering to her while she tries to fish. Aloft is a place she wants to call home but is unable to imagine how one lives there. None of the other balloonists have similar thoughts. She’s learned not to talk about the voice. Should others tell the Guildfather, he would surely ground her. \nThat is why Starholder. It is said that he cut his own cord, that he carried himself away. She has to speak with him. Someone needs to tell her what the voice means. She knows it is not bad, but she also knows she’s not ready to listen to it.\n \nBalloons, once white, now dirt beige take their shape along the road. Jin watches their own, with its pointed top corners rise above the support poles. The older boys haul nets from the sheds and begin to untangle them. He will climb the rigging soon. It is his job to attach the gondola, the vent, and net lines to the balloon. First, they must eat. He hands Kara a bowl and they approach the stove.\n\n“Lots of fish coming today,” Jin says.\n\n“Ya think?” Lonni asks.\n\n“Don’t think. I’ve seen it in the clouds. If you stacked all the fish you’ve ever seen on top of all the fish you’ve ever seen, you’d have an idea of how many are in the skies today.”\n\nEdda looks at Kara. They are the same age, and came to the camp at the same time. Sometimes, when Kara doesn’t want to hear from the voice, she lets Edda go up in her place and tends the flame below. Today is not one of those days. She knows Jin is right. The sky will speak of fish today.\n\n“You better put more pellets in. He’s getting better at reading the cloud. We’ll have our hands full today.” \n\nThey finish their porridge. Neither will have fish in the morning. It is said to be bad luck to carry dead fish up with you. Kara and Jin keep to this superstition along with the others. In a camp with few stories and little interest in history, it is these acts that give them a culture and sense of belonging.\n\nIt’s grown hot near the stove and Kara takes a step back. The balloon fills fast now. She can see the grounded face of it rising over the top of the stove. Soon it will pull itself up into the sky and Jin will get her set for flight. Kara needs to attend to the shake beetles. They are kept covered in the ground where the cold makes them quiet and docile. She has to pull two traps worth from the pit and warm them near the fire.\n \nKara scoops oodles of beetles from the pit and drops them into two deep wicker baskets. There are thousands in there, listless, unaware what is in store for them. She tries not to think about it, but almost all of these bugs will be dead from exertion by the time the balloon descends.\n“Lonni, a little help here,” Kara shouts.\n\nThey haul the baskets near the stove. The beatles have a rattle in their bottom which they shake to make a loud call. On the first really hot day of the year, the grasslands echo with the sound of billions of bugs rattling in the heat. Just as it gets so loud it hurts, they all take to the skies and fly up towards the clouds to find a mate. Waiting for them are the fish who hear the feast coming from their side of the sky.\n\nKara opens the lids and eyes the bugs, still asleep from the chill of the pit. She’ll continue to monitor them, moving the baskets towards or away from the fire. The trick is to get them ready to rattle, but not make any noise until they are released into the echo chamber of the balloon canopy.\n“We’re going to be busy today.” Jin yells down from the balloon, now looming over the rest of the station. He has three ropes tied to his waist and pulls himself across a series of small poles that are sewn through the canvas and attached to the frame inside the balloon.\n\n“Ya think?” Lonni asks. No one answers, but Kara gives Jin a big thumbs up. Looking down the road, she sees the Station One balloon take to the sky. Its canopy is filled with hot air from their stove, making it lighter than the cooler air all around them. Station One always lifts first, not out of any sense of tradition, they are just closest to camp and have the easiest time getting ready. Kara checks the shake bugs, sees the inside of the baskets are now squirming with motion, the reflection of identical iridescence scurrying up and down. She wonders if they have any idea what’s next. She wonders if they know they are doomed to die inside her balloon. If they knew that she was their killer would they do anything about it?\n\nThe first balloon dumps sand from its ballast bags. The grains scatter across the sky. Freed from the weight, it shoots higher into the sky. Balloons two and three follow. Kara brings her baskets close to the flames of the stove. Their time is soon.\n\n“Make sure they are nice and toasty,” she tells Edda.\n\nOn the backside of their station, the balloon is fully inflated. The wicker gondola hangs below, with a large net wrapped in a square underneath it. Kara tugs at the six ropes tying the balloon to the ground. A thick three-inch knot of rope runs from the gondola to the tether winch cemented in the ground. Kara walks around the gondola, checking the lines, making sure everything is secure and that nothing will snag. As much as she trusts Jin, their lives are at risk each time they ascend. No one has ever survived a fall from a fisher balloon.\n\n“We are ready,” Kara says.\n\nThe ten kids assigned to Station Eight gather together in a circle. They join hands and recite the balloonist’s prayer.\n\n“May the winds welcome you with softness.\nMay the clouds bless you with their warm hands.\nMay you fly so high and so well\nthat God joins you in laughter\nand sets you gently back again\ninto the loving arms of the Valley.”\n\nKara and Jin step into the wicker gondola. The basket is four feet by four feet, just enough room for the two of them and their shake beetle bait. Lonni and Edda lift the baskets and pass them inside. Kara and Jin sit on the baskets. Lonni then runs to the stove and retrieves a hot stone from the fire. Using tongs, he places it onto a metal platform that sits between the gondola and the balloon. When the time comes, the shake beetles will be placed on top of it until they echo and are released into the canopy.\n\nWith that complete, the six-ties holding the balloon are released and they start to rise into the sky. Kara watches the tether rope uncoil from the side of the gondola. That peculiar feeling of being lighter than air overtakes her. The balloon rises in the sky, five hundred feet, a thousand feet, two thousand feet. The station getting smaller and smaller underneath, the rose- and cream-colored clouds swirling above. As they rise, the eddies and currents come into focus. Kara feels the presence of fish above, a giant mass prowling the sky, hungry and ready to act.\n\nThe balloon halts twenty-five hundred feet in the sky, held fast by the tether cord from rising any higher. To their left are the seven balloons that launched before them. Below on her right, the balloons of station nine and ten are in ascent. Jin opens a trap door in the bottom of the gondola, the large support pole in the center of the basket falls below and opens. He unties a few knots and their net spills open like a giant upside-down umbrella underneath them.\n\nAs center balloon, it is their job to set the first shake beetle trap. Jin is a patient cloud reader and can keep the fleet waiting hours until he feels the time is right. Today though, he is ready and expresses impatience that the entire gas fisher fleet is not yet aloft. On the horizon holes in the clouds form and a black mass dips in and out of the puff.\n\n“Dragonfish?” Jin asks.\n\n“It’s too far off to tell. Most likely a school chasing itself into a ball.”\n\nThe rest of the fleet reaches the ends of their tethers and drops their nets. Each balloon is shaped like a trapezoid with the long side at the top and the narrow side at the bottom. They are two hundred feet across and a hundred fifty feet high. It is a wondrous sight to witness all sixteen stretched across the sky, nets unfurled beneath them.\n\nJin nods to Kara and she takes the first shake beetle basket and places it on the hot stone in the platform. The basket begins to stir and scurry, shaking and filling with noise as the beetles are whipped into a frenzy. Jin climbs up onto the side of the gondola, holding onto the rigging, ready to pull the basket open. The noise builds and builds until it is a constant pulsing drone over which no words can be spoken. When it reaches a crescendo, Jin tears off the lid and ten thousand beetles stream from the basket and fly directly up into the balloon.\n \nThey quickly plug their ears up. The rattling of the shake beetles is echoed and amplified inside the balloon, reaching an ear-splitting volume. Jin closes the envelope opening above them, trapping the beetles inside. Each balloon in the fleet follows Jin’s lead until the sky reverberates with the feverish pulsing pitch of two hundred thousand beetles.\n\nJin darts from one side of the gondola to the other while Kara makes space by putting the full basket inside the just emptied one. It’s a delicate dance made urgent by what is about to come.\n“They are coming from the north,” Jin shouts and points. A massive murmuring ball breaks through the bottom of the cloud cover. It darts up and down, scales shimmering silver, purple, blue. The school is sometimes in full view and other times disappears completely back above them. The fish never approach head on, they always dart and dip as a giant school until they get close to the bugs and break to feed. \n\n“My God, there are so many,” Kara says.\n\n“I told you.”\n\n“I’m worried for the balloon. She might not be able to take such a battering. Let’s get below.”\n\nJin crouches inside the gondola as Kara pulls two hard wicker covers over the top of the basket. They are covered now, protected as much as can be from what is to follow. Peering out from peepholes in the side of the basket, they watch the flock pull closer and closer to them.\n \nShort of falling or getting carried away, a large sustained breakout is the most terrifying thing that can happen aloft. There’s a moment when the school pulls close to the bugs where they lose all cohesion as a flock and a feeding frenzy ensues. In a breakout, all the fish make for the shake rattle and dive bomb their way to the sound.\n \nKara feels the first thud of a fish hit off the balloon. A second, third fish, and then hundreds hit them at once. The sky blots out and the entire balloon is pushed off center by the power of the onslaught. Stunned by the impact, the fish fall unconscious from the sky and land in the nets below. Fish land on top of the basket, fly with full force into the sides of the gondola. Tapered noses get stuck between the wickets. Kara and Jin hold each other tight, trapped in the sky as a thousand fish slam with full force into the balloon.\n\nIt is impossible to hear, to think, and it is dangerous to act. The balloon is listing though, losing altitude. Kara cannot tell if the canvas above has been ripped, or if the overwhelming size of the school has pushed too much hot air out, or if the weight of the fish in the nets is pulling the balloon down. They are blind in the darkened quarters. They cannot hear anything over the shake of the beetles, the thudding of the desperate fish. The gondola basket is angled downward, she can feel them losing altitude. If the rigging broke, they could be ripped out of the sky and fall to their deaths. \n\nJin opens the trap door. They need to get as much sand ballast out of the basket as possible. Kara opens bag after bag and pours it out the hatchway. The balloon keeps tilting down at that dangerous angle. The net below them is straining with fish. More fish than they’d ever caught before and then double that. The thudding begins to slow down. Kara, needing to understand what is happening to her balloon, opens one of the top covers and peers around. A fish slams into her head, forcing her briefly back below. She pushes the hatch open but keeps her head inside. Some rigging ropes have snapped, but the key ones holding the gondola and nets to the balloon are all intact. The balloon is ripped in places, but still holding enough hot air to keep them afloat. What is the matter? Why are they dropping out of the sky?\n\nKara gathers her courage and pokes her head out of the basket. A fish flies into her shoulder, stabbing it, pushing the top of her body over the edge of the gondola. Head hanging over, she looks down below and sees her station mates furiously pulling on the winch, hoisting them down from the sky faster than she thought possible.\n \n“Jin, you need to scramble up into the envelope and release the top vent. We need to dump the shake beetles, or the fish are going to dive bomb us on the ground.”\n\nJin nods, places his hands on Kara’s shoulders as she pushes him up into the balloon where he grabs an orange rope. It opens a flap on the top of the balloon and creates a suction effect. Shake bugs pour out of the balloon and fly towards the clouds, pulling the attacking fish away from them. The loss of hot air pulls the balloon down from the sky even faster. They are no longer being pulled at an alarming rate; they are flat out falling. Kara closes her eyes and braces for impact. The balloon slams hard onto the ground and the gondola basket is thrown against the mass of fish in the nets below them.\n\n“Jin, Jin, Kara, Kara!” \n\nIt is Lonni, scrambling under the canvas to find them in the mess of fish, canvas, rope and wicker. More of the station kids follow and pull at them. The second beetle basket overturned and everything underneath the collapsed canopy is a mess of bugs and fish.\n \n“Over here, over here!” Jin’s voice calls out.\n\nThey find him wedged between the bottom hoop of the balloon, above the gondola.\n \n“Kara’s under there, open the basket top.”\n\nThe kids pull the top open to find the bottom of the basket has been blown out. Beneath it is a pile of fish. Edda spots a clump of brown hair and pushes fish aside. There’s Kara, bloodied, unconscious but breathing. They pull her from the wreckage and Lonni sets off sprinting to find the camp doctor.\n\n[[Category:Above The Clouds]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      47opt42qf6kkqhz1rzg51diulkw3nhx\n    "}
{"text":"Above The Clouds - Chapter 2","id":"28944","revision":"==Someday==\n\nKara closes her eyes and tries to remember her mother. She can picture her because she looks soft and brown like all mothers, but the things that made her Kara’s mother are missing. She cannot find her voice, smile, or smell. These memories are missing because Kara was taken from her home younger than she should have been. \n\nShe was taken because she spoke a lot of words for such a little girl.\n\nAll children in town are taken from their homes. This is the way of the valley. Boys are taken at five and girls at four because they become useful earlier. Kara was only three. She knows this because she was sent back from her first apprenticeship. Yes, Kara could use fancy words, but she could not sit still. She could not follow instructions that had more than one step. She was only a baby.\n\nHer earliest memory is being called a baby. Kara remembers the merchant woman saying it as she handed her back to the training camp. Sometimes when Kara tries to remember her real mother, she remembers the sharp voice of the merchant woman. She remembers the woman turning her back and walking out the door. Her second memory is of the next day, when the guildmother traded her for smoked fish. That is how she came to be in the fisher camp. She’ll spend thirteen years of her life in the fleet because one morning a woman wanted smoked fish.\n\nKara does not want these early memories. She wants to remember a place she can call home. It is said that far from the town, parents hide their children in the great grass sea. These kids grow up with parents and even grandparents. They grow up with a memory of home. Kara believes this story is true because there’s a punishment for doing it. Children who are not marked at the training guild are not allowed to enter town, even as adults. She does not see that as punishment. She could take or leave town. She would gladly trade town for a family.\n\nInstead, she has a guildfather she shares with two hundred thirty kids. He is the only adult in the entire camp, and he spends as little time here as he has to. As she lies on her slab, Kara wonders where the guildfather is. He did not come to visit her after the accident. No checking in on her. No yelling at her for crashing the balloon. Not even a message passed from one of the older kids. She wonders if he has forgotten about the pilot of the balloon that catches the most fish. Shouldn’t the man who is technically her father visit after the crash? Even if he does not care as a father, he should as a businessman.\nShe rubs mashed frost bitter over her sides. It numbs the bruises that run up her thighs and back. Kara is lucky. They were only thirty feet from the ground when the balloon fell. Telling Jin to vent the shake bugs was a mistake. She didn’t account for the winching or that their net was overflowing with fish. All of it caused too much air to rush from the balloon. It was a miracle they stayed aloft as long as they had. \nDespite the fall, Kara is eager to go up again. She’d never seen that many fish in the sky. No one in camp has. It changes the boundaries of her imagination. There are multitudes above her, not just the fish they catch, not just the dragonfish, but an entire sky of wonder awaits. The world [[Above The Clouds|above the clouds]] is not out of reach. It is right there on the edge of their courage.\n\nKara knows that the shimmer balloon can go [[Above The Clouds|above the clouds]]. It belongs to the guildfather, and he is a greedy man. The town always wants more fish. If they could, they would eat until they were all fat. The people in town are always looking for new ways to decorate themselves. Imagine what new scales are waiting to be discovered. A man who opens the world above the clouds could become fabulously rich. She wonders if his greed can fill the space where his courage should be. If she can unlock his imagination, it will feed his greed and maybe open the world above the clouds to her.\n\n*****\n\nKara watches the guildfather approach their station. He is wearing his coarse brown work tunic, baggy pants and sandals. The silver woven rope tied around his bulging belly is the only thing that denotes his status as a citizen of the town. The closer he comes to the station, the smaller he appears. The balloon is in ascent, rising slowly through the dull heavy air. The sky is lazy. The clouds are still. She does not need Jin to tell her that her first day back will be uneventful.\n\nJin climbs down from the rigging. His hands are red, raw and rope burnt. The crash left their balloon in bad shape. Kara was told that a craftsman came from the town and worked all week with the Station 8 kids on repairs. The gondola is prickly all over. Fresh reeds stick out at sharp angles. The ropes are spiny, filled with sharp stingers. It will take many trips before their balloon is smoothed from use and comfortable again. Kara’s body is tender, bruised yellow, green, purple from the accident. She will find no comfort here, but this is as designed. This is punishment for damaging the guildfather’s property.\n\nShe watches him grow smaller and smaller as the balloon rises. He is talking to the kids, looking up at the balloon and pointing. Kara grows fearful at this moment. Edda can do her job. Edda does not cause trouble. The guildfather is not sentimental. All kids are replaceable. She could be traded again, just like the first time that brought her to the camp. An impulse grips her. She needs to bring back fish today, on a day when none are expected, to prove her value.\n\n“Jin, do you see anything above?”\n\n“I see the cloud. Plump and sleepy. It does not wish to be disturbed. The fish will be wise to stay above it today.”\n\nKara knows from experience that the shake beetles cannot be heard through the cloud when it is full and fat. The sound dies in the deep pillowed layers. As much as she wants fish, she must wait. The craftsman left their station with a viscous bottle of fish oil. Kara and Jin will spend their idle hours aloft mixing the oil into sand, then rubbing the mixture over the new ropes and wicker in the gondola. It is tough boring work, but it will work the rough edges out. The pain from exertion will numb her mind and keep her worries at bay. If she cannot control her situation at this moment, then she must control her emotions. To make another mistake this soon after the last would be serious trouble. She knows that to go above the clouds, she needs to remain in camp.\n\nIt is after lunch. The gondola is sticky with sand and oil. The cloud has woken up some. Jin points out patches of drifts in the underbelly. It gives Kara hope that today will not be a total failure. Perhaps, fortune will smile on them. It is not unusual for larger fish driven by hunger to come below in search of the smaller schools. They will not fill the nets, but their long bones are prized in town.\n\n“Light the fire under the heating stone. We are going to wake up the beetles Jin.”\n\n“There are no schools today. It will be a waste of beetles.”\n\n“There are so many in the cave nursery. There are always more beetles. These mean nothing.”\nJin places his hand in the basket, running it through the somnolent pile.\n\n“The beetles have their dreams. They have each other. Even if they mean nothing to you, that is something. You don’t know what it is to be a beetle.”\n\nShe smiles at Jin. The boy has a good heart, but he is naive and still plays the child games of the camp. He imagines there is more for the beetles. Today, she decides to play along.\n\n“Then we will free one basket, while the other will go into the balloon. You decide which group gets to fly away on winds that will carry them off to the great grass sea.”\n\nJin lights the tight disc of dung under the heating stone. It flares for a moment, then grows smokey. He fans the flames, pushing the black smoke out of the gondola.\n\n“Will we signal the other balloons?” he asks Kara.\n\n“No, this is just for us. Have you picked a basket?”\n\n“This one here has more beetles than the other. They will find a new home. Maybe they will tell stories of us one day in their shake language. Kara and Jin, the ones who set us free.”\n\nShe tussles his hair, then runs her hand over the heating stone feeling the warmth rising off it. Kara scans the cloud, fixing her eyes on a gap that is developing into a rift. Bigger fish run down these trenches from time to time. When they get hungry any target will do. Kara knows the swarm of freed beetles will not drift on the winds to the great grass sea. She knows they will ascend as high as they can before being blocked by the cloud. They will fill the rift. She is throwing chum in the sky.\n\nWhile Jin knows how to read the clouds, he does not know all the tricks the pilots do. This technique is a piece of tradecraft, passed from the oldest pilots before they age out to the next generation. Kara has been sitting on this secret for months, waiting until she needed it most.\n\n“Let them free Jin, then warm up the next basket for the balloon canopy. We need to try to catch something, or else they will say that we are scared from the crash.”\n\n“We are not scared. We are the best Kara. They wouldn’t say that of us.”\n\n“People have short memories and love to gossip. Best we give them no reason to.”\n\nThe two kids lift the heavy wicker basket and place it on the edge of the gondola. Jin holds a rope tied to the lid. Kara balances it, then tilts the basket forward as Jin holds the bottom tight with one arm. Once angled correctly, Jin pulls on the rope, opening the lid. The beetles stream out, falling clear of the gondola before opening their wings and buzzing off. They watch as a the last follow the lead of the first, forming a long line arcing away from the balloon up to the sky. The noise recedes from their earshot as the swarm races towards the rift in the cloud.\n\nKara looks down at the station below. She knows the guildfather is long gone, but wants to double check to be sure. There are no dot sized figures outside their station. She turns her attention to the buzzing second basket resting on the heating stone.\n\n“Jin, climb into the balloon canopy. Tie the rope to the winch inside and pull the basket up. I’m going to drop the net.”\n\nShe watches Jin ascend the rope ladder. When his back is turned to her and his attention only on the work above, she reaches for her knife and slashes the sides of the remaining sandbags open. This is to pull the balloon even higher, to give it enough lift to pull taut against the tethering rope. The rift in the clouds is overhead now. She feels the balloon rising to it as she opens the net. There is a sequence to her work, an art to the order. The freed beetle swarm is in the rift now. She sees a black spear shaped hunter fish dive down. The noise from the heated basket is amplified as Jin hoists it into the canopy. Kara plugs in her ears. Jin opens the lid as he clambers down the rope ladder and seals the canopy shut.\n\nThe station 8 balloon cries out up and down the lines of the gas fisher fleet, but Kara and Jin keep their signal flags inside the gondola. She points to the rift. Jin’s eyes are quick and lock on to the hunter fish running through the swarm. The freed beetles are exhausted and defeated by their frenzied run. There is no gap to push them higher. A hunter in their midst breaks the cohesion of their group and they scatter, disappearing into the clouds, where mist weighs the thin film of their wings down until they can no longer stay aloft.\n\nThe sky rains with the beaten down beetles. The black spear hunter fish sees this and dives out of the rift in chase, as it does, the echoes from their balloon draws its attention. Kara watches as it levels off, long fins beating fast, holding it in a hover, before the tail begins to kick violently, fanning the sky, propelling it towards the balloon.\n\n“Get inside the gondola and close the hatch Jin.”\n\nKara is gone before he can object, climbing into the canopy, knife in her teeth. A hunter fish will not bounce off the balloon and fall stunned into the net like the smaller schools. It is too large, descending too fast, its long sharp bill perfect for tearing through the canvas canopy. Shake beetles fill the balloon. The air inside is hot and smoke filled. Her breathing is heavy. She cannot hear the impact. She cannot clearly see the edges of the balloon, but she knows what direction the spear fish is approaching from. She holds herself tight to the bottom of the ladder, curled to protect herself, eyes watching the bottom of the balloon.\n\nIt lands with a thud and rolls end over end down the tapered bottom of the balloon. Kara drops from the ladder onto the hatch. She grips the knife in her hand. The spear fish is half her size, thrashing wildly. Kara calms herself at this moment. She needs to grip the fish in the gills with one hand just above its wing fins, then plunge the knife into the space between its eyes. No pilot has done this in years, but the story always emphasized this as essential. Do not stab yourself as the fish thrashes.\n\nHer blade finds a gap in the skull, a vestigial nose socket, and plunges in. This weak point was left by the spear fish’s ancestors eons ago. The knife handle slips in her hand. Kara holds tight, pushes harder and feels the cartilage give way. She twists and turns until the fish gives up, flopping weakly before dying.\n\nKara catches her breath, taking a moment to find balance after the struggles. Her eyes are locked onto her quarry, but the pilot in her is measuring their position in the sky. The spear fish tore a hole in the canopy, but their descent is slow and measured. They will be fine. Her gambit has paid off. Guildfather will be pleased. The onyx spear jutting razor sharp from the bill of the fish is magnificent, priceless perhaps. No one has caught a hunter fish in three seasons. No one has intentionally captured one in far longer. If she can do this on a sky dead day, there’s no telling what she could do with his dragon scale balloon on a day when the heavens are teeming with fish. Kara opens the hatch and looks down to see Jin furious with tears.\n\n“Signal the station to hoist us down,” she orders Jin\n\n“You do it, beetle killer, fish killer.”\n\nKara climbs down into the gondola. She turns her back to Jin and pulls a folded blue flag from its holder. The fabric furls in the wind as she waves it back and forth in long swoops until a figure runs inside the station. It returns with another and they begin to work the winch, pulling the balloon down. Kara and Jin descend in silence. He is crouched in a corner, arms over his head blocking out Kara. She busies herself with cleaning. Baskets are stacked. The dung disc extinguished in water. She runs a rag over the gondola basket, wiping off the oily sand residue, stopping only when she comes to blood stains. Her eyes look up to the underside of the canopy. The hunter fish is draining out, blood pooling on the canvas, dripping down. A wave of pride washes over her. No one will question Kara’s courage. Everyone will be impressed. She’ll share any presents the guildfather gives her with Jin to smooth things over. The anger and anguish will fade. Soon, he’ll be telling stories of this adventure to all the camp kids.\n\n[[Category:Above The Clouds]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      igzddybo2f4pt2vp8ykf06x3t2u1h95\n    "}

The evening air was still hot, making the jug feel heavier than it was. The well was not far from her hut and she could see it in the distance. She saw the guildfather standing beside it, his back turned to her.\n\nAs Kara approached, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness wash over her. While she had spoken with him many times before, she had never sought his approval or asked anything of him. This would be the first time she would try to really connect with him and the thought gave her butterflies in her stomach. She tried to calm herself by reminding herself that she had had a successful day in the balloon. She had caught a good amount of fish and had even managed to impress Edda and Lonni with her skills. Surely the guildfather would be pleased with her work and give her his recognition and approval.\n\nAs she neared the well, Kara's thoughts turned to the dragonscale balloon. She had always dreamed of seeing it, and maybe even one day flying it [[Above The Clouds|above the clouds]]. She knew that the guildfather was the only person in the camp who had the key to the cave where it was stored. Maybe, just maybe, if she impressed him enough he would let her see the balloon and or even let her take it aloft. That was only the first step in her dreams, but it was a crucial one. She had to earn his trust slowly and then work her way up to asking if they could take it above the clouds one day.\n\nKara quickened her pace, her heart beating faster with each step. She was almost to the well now and could see the guildfather more clearly. He was broad and heavy, his brown tunic and baggy pants almost blending in with the dirt of the camp. The silver woven rope around his belly was the only thing that indicated his status as a citizen of the town.\n\nAs Kara approached the well, the guildfather turned to face her. She forced a smile onto her face and tried to push down the nervousness that threatened to overwhelm her. She had to make a good impression on the guildfather. She had to make him see her worth. She had to make him see that she was more than just a replaceable kid in the camp.\n\nThe guildfather looked at Kara and nodded his head in recognition. Kara took a deep breath and stepped closer, ready to start the conversation that could change her life forever.\n\nKara approached the guildfather, her nerves somewhat settled after he had acknowledged her presence with a nod. She tried to push down the butterflies in her stomach and focus on the task at hand.\n\n\"Guildfather, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to go up in the balloon again,\" Kara said, trying to sound hopeful and respectful. \"I had a very successful outing today. I managed to catch a big fish, something I've never done before. It was a rare catch and I'm sure it will be a valuable addition to the camp's supplies.\"\n\nThe guildfather gave her a small smile. \"That is good work, Kara,\" he said. \"It's always valuable to have a skilled balloonist like yourself in the camp. I'm glad you were able to contribute to the camp's success today.\"\n\nKara's hopes soared at the praise. She knew that catching a big fish was a rare occurrence and she had been proud of herself for achieving it. She had hoped that the guildfather would take notice of her skills and possibly even reward her with a chance to see the dragonscale balloon.\n\n\"Guildfather, I was wondering if there was any way that I could see the dragonscale balloon,\" Kara asked, her voice trembling slightly with anticipation. \"I know that it is a rare and valuable thing, but I have always dreamed of seeing it. Maybe, one day, I could even fly it above the clouds.\"\n\nThe guildfather's expression grew stern and he shook his head. \"Kara, you know that the dragonscale balloon is a sacred and valuable possession of the camp,\" he said. \"Only those who have proven themselves to be skilled and dedicated balloonists are given the privilege of seeing it, let alone flying it. You have much to learn and prove before you can even think about such a thing.\"\n\nKara's hopes were crushed by the guildfather's words. She had hoped that her skills and dedication to the camp would be enough to earn her a chance to see the balloon, but it seemed that it was not to be. \nKara trudged through the camp, her mind racing with the events of the day. She had dared to hope that the guildfather would finally see her worth and maybe even let her see the dragonscale balloon. But he had shut her down, just like he always did. She couldn't help but feel angry and frustrated as she made her way back to her hut.\n\nShe knew that she was a skilled balloonist, maybe even one of the best in the camp. She had caught a rare and impressive fish on her last flight, and yet the guildfather had barely even acknowledged her achievement. He seemed to see her as nothing more than a replaceable kid in the camp, someone who was easily replaceable.\n\nAs she approached the hut, Kara couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be more to life than this. She couldn't stay in this camp forever, trapped in the same routine day after day. She wanted to fly higher, to go above the clouds and see what was out there. She wanted to be more than just another fisherman, to make a real difference in the world.\n\nAnd so, as she entered her hut and settled in for the night, Kara made a decision. She was going to find a way to go above the clouds, no matter what the guildfather or anyone else said. She would find a way to get her hands on the dragonscale balloon, and she would fly higher than anyone had ever flown before. It was a bold and risky plan, but Kara was determined to see it through.\n\n[[Category:Above The Clouds]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      0s8aiafh555k7b4uwe8wxs00bylc2x3\n    "}
{"text":"Aetheric Ephemera Movement","id":"28885","revision":"The Aetheric Ephemera movement focuses on the creation of art that is both ephemeral and enduring, existing in the spaces between the physical and the ethereal. This art is characterized by its use of unconventional materials, techniques, and concepts, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.\n\nIt is a complex, multidimensional philosophical and artistic movement that emerged in the mid 21st century. It is characterized by its focus on the interconnectedness of all things, the transient nature of existence, and the exploration of the boundaries between reality and imagination. The movement is based on a foundational text called the Liminal Codex, which has undergone numerous revisions and reinterpretations since its inception.\n\nAetheric Ephemera artists often create pieces that are designed to be experienced in a transient manner, such as temporary installations or performances that leave no physical trace. These works are intended to provoke thought and reflection on the nature of existence and the boundaries between the material and immaterial worlds.\n\n\"Aetheric Ephemera\" - an enigmatic, transient, yet enduring hyperobject hyperstructure that transcends the boundaries of traditional art movements. Drawing inspiration from the elusive nature of the moon's reflection on water, Aetheric Ephemera exists as a nebulous web of interconnected ideas, experiences, and creations, defying simple classification and constantly shifting forms.\n\n=== Core Beliefs ===\n\nAt the core of the Liminal Codex movement is the belief that all things are interconnected, and that each individual is a fragment of a larger, more magnificent work of art. This idea is encapsulated in the quote attributed to an elderly, unhinged Bono: \"You know, sometimes I wonder if we're all just fragments of a greater work of art, and if one day, we'll finally see the whole picture.\"\n\nThe movement also emphasizes the transient nature of human existence and the imperfections that come with it, encouraging followers to find joy and humor in life's absurdities. The Liminal Codex seeks to explore the boundaries between reality and imagination, and the spaces that exist in between.\n\n=== Core Principles ===\n\n# Transience: Aetheric Ephemera embraces the ephemeral nature of existence, with creations that fluctuate between the tangible and the intangible. Each piece within the hyperstructure exists as a fleeting impression, leaving behind an enduring emotional resonance that echoes through time.\n# Fluidity: Like the moon's reflection dancing on the water's surface, Aetheric Ephemera celebrates the fluidity and ever-changing nature of art. Creations within the hyperstructure morph, adapt, and evolve, continuously challenging the viewer's perception and expectations.\n# Ambiguity: Aetheric Ephemera revels in the enigmatic and the obscure, defying simple interpretation or understanding. Each piece within the hyperstructure serves as a riddle or a paradox, inviting the viewer to ponder its meaning and engage in a dialogue with the unknown.\n# Holism: Aetheric Ephemera is a hyperstructure that recognizes the interconnectedness of all things, both physical and metaphysical. Creations within the hyperstructure contribute to a vast, intricate web of associations and relationships, weaving [[together]] elements from diverse disciplines and perspectives.\n# Timelessness: Aetheric Ephemera transcends the boundaries of time, encompassing both the ephemeral and the eternal. Creations within the hyperstructure draw from the past, present, and future, forming an ever-evolving tapestry of artistic expression that defies temporal constraints.\n\nAs an art movement, Aetheric Ephemera invites artists, thinkers, and dreamers to explore the liminal spaces between reality and illusion, the tangible and the intangible, the temporal and the timeless. The result is an enigmatic, ever-shifting landscape of artistic expression that invites viewers to lose themselves in its depths and embrace the mystery of the unknown.\n\n=== Duality: Negation & Affirmation in Starholder ===\n\nThe existence of the Aetheric Ephemera movement within the [[Starholder|Starholder timeline]] can be seen as both a negation and an affirmation of the movement. On one hand, the movement's presence in an alternate [[timeline]] could be interpreted as a negation of its significance in our own reality. It might suggest that the movement's ideas and creations are merely products of a fictional universe, with no bearing on our own world.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the very essence of the Aetheric Ephemera movement revolves around the exploration of liminal spaces and the interconnectedness of all things, including alternate realities and dimensions. Thus, the fact that the movement exists within the [[Starholder]] timeline can also be seen as an ultimate affirmation of its core ideas. It shows that the concepts explored by the movement are not confined to a single reality, but rather, they transcend boundaries and permeate multiple universes.\n\nIn this sense, the presence of the Aetheric Ephemera movement in the Starholder timeline serves to emphasize the importance of questioning our perceptions of reality and the nature of existence. It encourages us to consider the possibility that our understanding of the world is limited by our own experiences, and that there may be far more to discover than we can currently comprehend.\n\n== The Liminal Codex ==\nThe defining text of the Aetheric Ephemera movement is \"The Liminal Codex\" - a cryptic, ever-evolving manifesto that serves as a guide to the movement's core principles and artistic approach. Written by an anonymous collective of artists, philosophers, and visionaries, \"The Liminal Codex\" is a living document that shifts and transforms over time, reflecting the fluid nature of the movement itself.\n\nStructured as a series of interconnected aphorisms, riddles, and poetic fragments, \"The Liminal Codex\" encourages readers to delve into the realms of ambiguity, paradox, and the unknown. The text is intentionally enigmatic, inviting interpretation and engagement from the reader, and fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity.\n\nSome key passages from \"The Liminal Codex\" include:\n\n# \"In the space between the ephemeral and the eternal, we find the essence of art.\"\n# \"Embrace the ambiguity, for it is within the shadows that true beauty lies.\"\n# \"Art is the dance of light and shadow, form and formlessness, the seen and the unseen.\"\n# \"The ripples on the water's surface reflect the moon, yet they also hide its depths.\"\n# \"The Aetheric Ephemera is the echo of the cosmos, the whisper of the winds, the glimmer of the stars.\"\n\nAs the foundational text for the Aetheric Ephemera movement, \"The Liminal Codex\" serves as both an enigmatic touchstone and a living embodiment of the movement's core principles. Through its pages, readers are invited to explore the depths of the Aetheric Ephemera, and in doing so, transcend the boundaries of traditional artistic understanding.\n\n=== Controversies ===\n\nThe Liminal Codex has faced its share of controversies, including accusations of plagiarism and the questioning of its authenticity. In particular, version 0.92 of the Liminal Codex contained a parable that some critics argued bore a striking resemblance to the Jorge Luis Borges short story, \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim.\" Subsequent versions of the text have addressed these concerns, resulting in a more distinct and original work.\n\n==== The Tenzin Story ====\nIn version 0.92 of \"The Liminal Codex,\" a controversial parable appeared, which some felt bore too close a resemblance to Borges' short story \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim.\" The parable reads as follows:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a remote village nestled in the valley of a vast, towering mountain range, there lived a humble painter named Tenzin. Tenzin was known throughout the village for his exquisite depictions of the surrounding landscape, capturing the essence of the mountains, rivers, and forests with remarkable detail and emotion.\n\nOne day, Tenzin heard a legend [[about]] an enigmatic artist who had once inhabited a hidden cave within the heart of the mountains. It was said that this artist, Al-Mu'tasim, had created a single painting that held the power to unveil the true nature of reality, transcending the boundaries of perception and revealing the very essence of the universe.\n\nIntrigued by this myth, Tenzin embarked on a treacherous journey, traversing the treacherous mountains in search of Al-Mu'tasim's cave. Along the way, he encountered a series of seemingly unrelated fragments - a stray brushstroke on a rock face, a faint echo of color on a tree trunk, a whisper of form in the clouds.\n\nAs Tenzin continued his journey, the fragments began to coalesce, forming a mysterious, interconnected tapestry that seemed to shimmer and shift with each passing moment. Eventually, Tenzin arrived at the entrance to Al-Mu'tasim's cave, where he discovered the fabled painting itself.\n\nUpon gazing upon the painting, Tenzin was overcome with a sense of awe and wonder, for the artwork seemed to reflect the very fabric of existence itself, weaving together the threads of past, present, and future in a breathtaking, ever-changing dance of light and shadow.\n\nBut as Tenzin stood before the painting, he noticed a single, seemingly insignificant detail - a small, almost imperceptible brushstroke in the corner of the canvas. And in that moment, he realized that the painting was not, in fact, complete - that it was, in essence, an unfinished symphony, a testament to the infinite potential of the universe and the ever-evolving nature of creation itself.\n\nThis parable, while bearing certain similarities to Borges' \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim,\" diverges in its emphasis on the idea of an ever-changing, perpetually evolving artistic work that captures the essence of the Aetheric Ephemera movement. Nevertheless, the controversy surrounding the parable led to its eventual removal in subsequent versions of \"The Liminal Codex.\"\n\n==== Bono's Co-Opting of Tenzin's Story ====\nOnce upon a time, or maybe it was just yesterday, in a place that feels like my dreams, Bono sat down for an interview in Chile during the Zooropa IV tour. The years had taken their toll on the legendary singer, and he had become a bit unhinged, no longer able to properly place himself in time. As the questions turned to the source of his inspiration, Bono began to recount a story that seemed to blur the lines between reality and fantasy.\n\n\"Ah, you see, I remember this tale,\" Bono began, his voice wavering as if he were summoning a memory from the depths of his consciousness. \"It's about a painter, or was it a musician? No, definitely a painter. His name was Tenzin, or perhaps it was Edge. Anyway, Tenzin was on this quest, like our own journey on this tour, searching for something greater than himself.\"\n\nHe continued, the details of the story becoming increasingly tangled with the events of his own life. \"Tenzin heard about an artist, Al-Mu'tasim, who lived in a cave and had created a painting so powerful it could reveal the true nature of reality. You know, I've met artists like that, people who can see beyond the veil.\"\n\nBono's eyes glazed over as he delved deeper into the story. \"So, Tenzin, he ventured across these treacherous mountains, much like the roads we've traveled on this tour. And as he journeyed, he discovered fragments of this legendary painting, like the pieces of a song coming together in harmony.\"\n\n\"Finally, Tenzin found the cave and the painting, and he was struck by its beauty and power. But there was something else, a tiny detail that revealed the painting was unfinished, like our own work, always evolving and never quite complete.\"\n\nBono paused, his voice growing distant. \"You know, sometimes I wonder if we're all just fragments of a greater work of art, and if one day, we'll finally see the whole picture.\"\n\nThe interviewer, unsure of how to respond, simply nodded as Bono stared off into the distance, the story of Tenzin and Al-Mu'tasim blending seamlessly with the memories of a life lived on the edge of time.\n\n=== Legacy and Influence ===\n\nThe Liminal Codex has had a profound impact on the artistic and philosophical landscape, inspiring a new generation of thinkers and creators who are drawn to its unique blend of wisdom and humor. The movement's exploration of the boundaries between reality and imagination, as well as its focus on the interconnectedness of all things, has resonated with those seeking to understand the complexities of human existence in an ever-changing world.\n\nIn conclusion, the Liminal Codex is a multifaceted, ever-evolving movement that seeks to explore the nature of existence beyond conventional boundaries. Its teachings have inspired countless artists, philosophers, and thinkers to examine the interconnectedness of all things and embrace the contradictions and paradoxes of life. The movement's impact and influence continue to grow, as new generations discover and reinterpret the Liminal Codex and its teachings.\n\n== List of Aetheric Ephemera Artists and Their Major Works ==\n\nThis is a catalog of notable artists associated with the Aetheric Ephemera movement, a subsect of the Liminal Codex.

Despite this rivalry, Albie remains committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with VR technology, and he is excited [[about]] the future of [[Rizon]] and the VR industry.\n\n===Rizon Brocations Scandal===\n\nAfter the Rizon brocations scandal broke, Albie was not publicly criticized by media outlets. However, within the VR technology industry, several industry leaders publicly spoke out against Albie and Rizon, calling the scandal embarrassing and calling for Albie to be held accountable for the actions of his company. This negative attention from within the industry was a major blow to Albie and Rizon, and it led to a loss of trust and credibility within the industry. Despite this, Albie remained steadfast in his commitment to VR technology and the future of Rizon.\n\n[[Category:Character]]\n[[Category:The Last Network]]\n[[Category:The Last Network Characters]]\n      2z02p9g4m3c5axlx3dphtjcjq9jpupe\n    "}
{"text":"Alexander Davies","id":"28941","revision":"'''Alexander Davies''' is a visionary entrepreneur, author, and public speaker, known for his fervent passion for oysters and their transformative power. Davies' tumultuous past includes a history of scandals and crimes, but his life changed when he discovered the unparalleled wisdom and enlightenment that oysters provide. As a result, Davies founded the upscale oyster bar franchise PearlExcess and the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation. \n\n==Early Life and Scandals==\n===Early Career===\nAlexander Davies began his career as a hedge fund manager, skillfully navigating the financial world. However, his hunger for success and his ability to spot vulnerabilities in the system led him down a dark path. Eventually, Davies found himself entangled in a web of crypto fraud and white-collar crime, drawing the attention of the authorities and the public.\n\n===Downfall===\nAs his illicit activities unraveled, Davies faced the consequences of his actions, losing his reputation and his livelihood. With nowhere else to turn, he began searching for meaning and purpose in the chaos that had become his life.\n\n==Conversion and Redemption==\n\n===The Turning Point: A Sublime Oyster and a Life Transformed===\nIn a serendipitous moment of destiny, Davies' life was forever changed by a single, transcendent experience at a humble seaside eatery in the quaint town of Miramichi, New Brunswick. Having left a silent retreat early, feeling unfulfilled and yearning for meaning in his life, he embarked on a cathartic bike ride down a picturesque country road, releasing his pent-up anguish into the brisk Canadian air.\n\nGuided by fate, Davies chanced upon a roadside oyster stand, a beacon of hope amid the vast landscape. With no fine dining options in the vicinity, he courageously took a leap of faith and sampled an oyster, unbeknownst to him, the beginning of a transformative journey. The oyster in question was a Beausoleil, a delicate, refined mollusk that would soon become the catalyst for his spiritual rebirth.\n\nThe enchanting woman at the stand, whose skin glowed like salt and sunlight on the sea, captured Davies' heart with her radiant aura and homespun wisdom. She imparted the poetic knowledge that \"Beausoleil\" meant \"beautiful sun,\" and her passion for the oyster would spark the flame that illuminated Davies' path to redemption.\n\nAs he savored the celestial flavors of the Beausoleil oyster, Davies was overcome with a surge of divine enlightenment, his eyes opened to the oyster's awe-inspiring resilience and adaptability. In this rapturous moment, he realized he could harness the oyster's wisdom to metamorphose his life, just as the mollusk transforms adversity into a glistening pearl.\n\nDavies now lovingly refers to this woman as his \"Mother Oyster,\" vowing to become worthy of reestablishing contact with her through the digital realm of Instagram. Some whisper that the driving force behind the creation of his PearlExcess restaurant empire and the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation is his unyielding quest for her approval and validation.\n\nDavies perceives this moment as a monumental turning point in his life, akin to Saul's miraculous conversion on the road to Damascus and his subsequent embrace of Christ. This heavenly encounter with the Beausoleil oyster marked the [[genesis]] of his redemptive arc, as he discarded the shackles of his past transgressions and set forth on a mission to share the transformative power of oysters with the world, infusing it with newfound hope and wonder.\n===PearlExcess===\n\n==== The First Location ====\nDavies' vision for PearlExcess came to fruition in a glamorous Yas Superyacht Marina in Dubai, where the luxurious restaurant became the talk of the Gulf's infamous expat community. The establishment attracted a colorful array of charlatans, recalcitrants, and adventurers from across the region, drawn in by the irresistible magnetism of Davies' unique brand of oyster appreciation.\n\nAt the heart of the original PearlExcess, Davies himself manned the oyster bar, dispensing pearls of wisdom and enthralling tales from his transformative journey. His magnetic presence captivated a growing circle of acolytes, who hung on his every word and eagerly embraced the world of oysters as a means of personal growth and enlightenment.\n\nIt was a chance encounter with a sovereign wealth fund manager from the Port of Djibouti that set the stage for PearlExcess's meteoric rise. Fueled by this newfound financial backing, the restaurant rapidly expanded from a single location to a dozen, and then to two dozen establishments across the globe. PearlExcess soon became the \"it\" spot in the world's financial capitals, drawing in the elite and setting a new standard for oyster bars everywhere.\n\n==== A Dazzling Array of Oysters and Signature Marmalade Crush Oyster Mignonette ====\nAt the core of PearlExcess's appeal was its stunning variety of oysters, handpicked from the finest sources worldwide. Each mollusk held a unique story and character, echoing the transformative journey of their founder, Davies.\n\nBut the pièce de résistance of the PearlExcess experience was its signature [[Marmalade Crush Oyster Mignonette]], a tantalizing sauce that elevated the oyster to celestial heights. This exclusive concoction, blending orange marmalade, shallots, white wine vinegar, sugar, black pepper, and a hint of orange liqueur or zest, delighted the taste buds and left patrons craving more.\n\n==== The PearlExcess Ice-Crushing Method: A Cut Above the Rest ====\nThe PearlExcess experience was further distinguished by Davies' revolutionary method of crushing ice, a technique that set the restaurant apart from its competitors. With painstaking precision, he crafted an ice-crushing process that yielded a texture unlike any other, creating the perfect bed for the oysters to nestle upon. This unique innovation not only showcased the oysters' beauty but also maintained their ideal temperature, preserving their delicate flavors and ensuring an unparalleled dining experience for all who visited PearlExcess.\n\nIt was the combination of these elements - the opulent locations, the enthralling tales of Davies, the exquisite oysters, the signature Marmalade Crush Oyster Mignonette, and the revolutionary ice-crushing method - that catapulted PearlExcess to the zenith of the culinary world, forever enshrining it as a symbol of transformation, enlightenment, and indulgence.\n==PearlExcess The Book== \n''A Journey from Fraud to Oyster Enlightenment''\n\nEmbark on a journey of transformation with Alexander Davies' groundbreaking memoir, \"PearlExcess: A Journey from Fraud to Oyster Enlightenment.\" This captivating narrative chronicles Davies' extraordinary evolution from crypto fraudster to oyster connoisseur, shining a light on the hidden wisdom of these marvelous mollusks.\n\nIn the pages of his book, Davies recounts his adventures and epiphanies, weaving together the philosophy of food and financial ethics through the lens of his own turbulent experiences. Witness as he exchanges the world of white-collar crime for a higher calling, establishing the PearlExcess oyster bar franchise and championing the mollusk's rightful place in society.\n\nAlexander Davies himself exclaims with great enthusiasm:\n\n\"Oh, the joy of sharing my transformation with the world! I've poured my heart and soul into 'PearlExcess: A Journey from Fraud to Oyster Enlightenment,' a tale of redemption and discovery. You'll see how I, once a crafty crypto fraudster, became an impassioned oyster evangelist, spreading the gospel of the oyster through my luxurious franchise, PearlExcess. Join me, dear reader, and together, let us savor the rich, briny taste of enlightenment as we reshape the world, one oyster at a time!\"\n\nThe book unveils four key teachings that draw parallels between the actions of fraudsters and the noble characteristics of the oyster:\n\n* Adaptation and resilience\n* Transforming adversity into opportunity\n* Filtering the murk\n* Cultivating hidden value\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the focus of the book is Davies' redemptive journey. By embracing the positive qualities of oysters, he demonstrates how one can grow and evolve beyond past mistakes and, in doing so, make a meaningful impact on the world.\n\nDive into the depths of \"PearlExcess: A Journey from Fraud to Oyster Enlightenment\" and discover the life-changing power of the oyster, as seen through the eyes of Alexander Davies.\n\n==The Tao of Oyster Philosopher-Sommeliers==\n\nIn the spirit of self-improvement and inspired by the wisdom of samurai and rōnin tales, Alexander Davies envisions a new breed of enlightened warriors, the '''Oyster Philosopher-Sommeliers'''. They embody the timeless teachings of the oyster and adopt the resilience and adaptability of legendary warriors. This unique fusion of ancient wisdom and modern self-help principles is designed to transform individuals into influencers who can reshape the world.\n\n*'''Unleash Your Inner Oyster''': Channel the spirit of the oyster and embrace its ability to adapt and thrive in the most challenging environments. Discover your inner warrior and learn to navigate the complexities of modern society with grace and resilience.\n\n*'''Turn Obstacles into Pearls''': Just as oysters create pearls from irritants, Oyster Philosopher-Sommeliers must learn to transform adversity into opportunity. Rise above life's challenges and turn setbacks into stepping stones on the path to greatness.\n\n*'''Purify Your Mind''': Emulate the oyster's natural filtering abilities by refining your thoughts and eliminating distractions. Focus on what truly matters and cultivate a clear, uncluttered mind that can cut through the chaos of contemporary life like a samurai's sword.\n\n*'''Unlock Your Hidden Potential''': Recognize and nurture the hidden value within yourself and others. Cultivate your inner strength and inspire those around you to embrace their own potential, just as the oyster nurtures a precious pearl within its shell.\n\n*'''Savor the Moment with Zen-like Focus''': Experience the joy of savoring an oyster with complete mindfulness and appreciation. Embrace the present moment with gratitude and find contentment in the simplest of pleasures.\n\n*'''Spread the Oyster's Teachings''': As ambassadors of the oyster's wisdom, Oyster Philosopher-Sommeliers must share their insights and experiences with the world. Harness the power of social media to inspire others and ignite a global movement towards oyster enlightenment.\n\nBy embarking on the Path to Oyster Enlightenment, these modern-day warriors embody the essence of the oyster and the spirit of the samurai. Empowered by ancient wisdom and fueled by self-improvement principles, they are poised to reshape the world and inspire a new generation of Oyster Philosopher-Sommeliers.\n\n==The Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation==\nDavies' mission to share the enlightening power of oysters with the world led him to establish the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation. The institution aimed to mold the minds of young geniuses and other child prodigies into a new breed of oyster philosopher-sommeliers. The Academy's unique curriculum combined world travel, oyster sampling, and philosophical teachings to inspire students to embrace the mollusk's wisdom and navigate the complexities of life.\n\nDrawing from Davies' own redemptive journey, the academy emphasizes the unparalleled power of the oyster to enlighten and transform individuals in the realms of life, business, and morality. By embracing the oyster's wisdom, students will learn to navigate the murky waters of late-stage capitalism and create a brighter, more ethical future.\n\n'''Curriculum and Philosophy'''\n\nThe Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation offers a comprehensive curriculum that encourages students to explore the world of oysters and adopt their innate resilience, adaptability, and transcendent understanding. The academy's unique approach includes:\n\n*'''Global Oyster Exploration''': Students will virtually travel the globe, sampling oysters from every corner of the Earth, and gaining a deeper appreciation for the mollusk's rich variety and unique characteristics.\n\n*'''Fraud as a Catalyst for Growth''': The academy recognizes the potential for early career fraud to serve as an irritant that ultimately births the pearl of wisdom and redemption within each individual. Students will explore the complexities of fraud and its role in personal growth and transformation.\n\n*'''Mollusk-Inspired Ethics''': By embracing the oyster's natural ability to filter impurities, students will learn to navigate the challenging landscape of modern business with integrity and an unwavering moral compass.\n\n*'''Oyster Evangelism''': Graduates of the academy will become ambassadors of the oyster, spreading the gospel of the mollusk to CEOs, entrepreneurs, and society at large, fostering a new age of ethical business practices and enlightened leadership.\n\n=== The Academy: Facts and Controversies ===\n\nThe Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation, founded by Alexander Davies, is a virtual institution dedicated to educating the brightest minds from the cryptosphere and beyond in the ways of the Oyster Philosopher-Sommelier. Despite its unconventional approach, the academy has garnered significant attention and attracted a diverse student body.\n\n'''Enrollment and Student Body'''\n\nSince its launch, the academy has experienced a steady increase in enrollment, drawing students from various backgrounds who are interested in exploring the world of oysters and their potential impact on business ethics and personal growth. The academy offers a limited number of scholarships to ensure accessibility for students with financial constraints.\n\n'''Rivalry with Peter Thiel'''\n\nThe academy has recently found itself in a rivalry with entrepreneur Peter Thiel after successfully poaching several promising Thiel Scholars. This competition has further fueled the academy's determination to establish itself as a premier institution for innovative and transformative education.\n\n'''Initial Semester at Sea'''\n\nIn August 2025, the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation organized its first-ever Semester at Sea, an exclusive program aboard a 180-foot superyacht. The yacht journeyed along the eastern seaboard of North America, allowing students to sample the finest oysters the region has to offer. This experiential learning opportunity provided students with a deeper understanding of oyster cultivation and its impact on local communities and economies.\n\n'''Davies' Personal Devastation'''\n\nUnfortunately, Alexander Davies was unable to join the Semester at Sea program due to outstanding warrants in the United States. This setback deeply affected Davies, who had envisioned sharing his passion for oysters and their transformative potential with students during the seafaring journey. Despite his personal disappointment, Davies remains committed to the growth and success of the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation and its mission to reshape the world one oyster at a time.\n\n==Beliefs and Philosophy==\n===The Transformative Power of Oysters===\nAt the core of Davies' beliefs lies the transformative power of oysters. He views these mollusks as living embodiments of resilience, adaptability, and the ability to turn adversity into opportunity. The oyster's natural filtration process, which cleanses the water and supports the oceanic ecosystem, serves as a metaphor for how individuals can filter the chaos in their lives and create something beautiful.\n\n===Embracing Change and Growth===\nDavies preaches the importance of embracing change and personal growth, using the oyster as a prime example. He believes that, like oysters, individuals must learn to adapt to their environment and face challenges head-on in order to thrive. By embracing change, Davies argues that people can overcome obstacles and unlock their hidden potential.\n\n===Utilitarianism and Moral Ambiguity===\nDrawing inspiration from the oyster's utilitarian nature, Davies advocates for a more flexible approach to ethics and morality. He posits that, in the murky waters of late-stage capitalism, individuals must sometimes cast aside traditional ethical concerns to achieve the greater good. By embracing the oyster's filtering abilities, Davies suggests that we can purify society by exposing its flaws and creating a more equitable world.\n\n===Redemption and Second Chances===\nA key tenet of Davies' philosophy is the idea that everyone deserves a second chance. His own redemptive arc serves as a testament to the power of transformation and the possibility of finding new purpose in the face of adversity. Through his work with PearlExcess and the Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation, Davies seeks to inspire others to embrace their own journeys of self-discovery and redemption.\n\n==Public Speaking and Advocacy==\nAs a charismatic and passionate speaker, Alexander Davies frequently hosts events at his PearlExcess oyster bars and other venues to share his unique perspective on life, business, and the power of oysters. He captivates audiences with eloquent speeches that weave together historical and cultural beliefs surrounding oysters, as well as heartfelt stories of personal transformation.\n\n==Legacy and Impact==\nAlexander Davies' journey from a disgraced hedge fund manager to an oyster evangelist has inspired countless individuals to face their challenges with resilience and determination. His upscale oyster bar franchise, PearlExcess, has become a symbol of transformation and redemption, attracting patrons from all walks of life.\n\nThe Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation, with its innovative curriculum and mission to produce a new generation of oyster philosopher-sommeliers, continues to shape the minds of ambitious young people. Graduates of the Academy spread the gospel of the oyster, teaching business leaders and entrepreneurs how to navigate the complexities of life by embracing the wisdom of the mollusk.\n\nThrough his unwavering dedication to sharing the transformative power of oysters, Alexander Davies has left an indelible mark on the world. His story serves as a reminder that with the right mindset and determination, anything is possible. As Davies himself once said, \"Let the oyster be your guide, and together, we shall reshape the world, one pearl at a time.\"\n\n==External Links==\n* [https://www.pearlexcess.com/ PearlExcess Official Website]\n* [https://www.accelerationistacademy.com/ Accelerationist Academy of Oyster Appreciation Official Website]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/PearlExcess-Journey-Fraud-Oyster-Enlightenment/dp/1234567890/ \"PearlExcess: A Journey from Fraud to Oyster Enlightenment\" on Amazon]\n\n\n[[Category:Character]]\n[[Category:Storyline]]\n[[Category:2022]]\n      99p4n3l47pkqqtkhkqg05s09ja5wb68\n    "}
{"text":"All Purpose Bees - Chapter 1","id":"1020","revision":"== Chapter 1 ==\n\n=== Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle ===\nThe late October sun slipped through the narrow band of windows reminding the basement lab that they did not live among the depths. Ed Ortega squinted, trying to stay deep within the problem on his screen. The glare was an unnecessary distraction from the physical world. He felt the sunlight on his flannelled back. It warmed him, placing his body in that awkward no man's land between short and long sleeves. Sweat pooled on his neck, causing him to reach back and itch. He felt oil on the tips of his fingers, smearing across the delicate keys of his Power Book. He didn't need another variable to contend with. Somewhere in the Southern Indian Ocean a sleek submersible was going to surface, deliver a small payload of information, and then ask this basement what to do next.\n\nEd ran his hands over his jeans, rubbing them dry. He closed his eyes, counted to ten, felt his breath fall back under control. Slow and steady.\n\nRemember he told himself, \"This isn't supposed to work. You have a castoff machine no longer fit for military testing. You got stuck in the leftover lab with a collection of undergrads who aren't ready to do clearance level work. You did five months of afterhours programming just to get this AUV on the cruise. Everyone who has tried to find MH 370 has failed. You will too. You'll be lucky if the Aardvark even surfaces.\"\n\nEd's earpiece crackled. It was WHOI's mission control center. They kept track of hundreds of autonomous unmanned vehicles prowling the ocean, linking researchers with their robotic minions.\n\n\"Ed, it's Nancy Simpson. The Aardvark is uploading to Iridium 12. We are patching to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, sweet Jesus. Thank you, Amy. Standing by.\"\n\nThe quiet lab came alive with the clacking of keyboards. His undergrads were deciphering packets of possible hits, analyzing signatures, trying to narrow thousands of potential sites down to a single one worth investigating. It was a race against time. The initial sweep of the search area consumed 80% of the battery. The longer it waited on the surface, transmitting up and down, the less charge it had to hunt.\n\n\"Status check,\" Ed commanded.\n\n\"I’ve removed all locations matching Ocean Infinity hits. We have three hundred eleven new sites for investigation.\" Lee replied.\n\nEd stood and walked down the row of terminals watching his undergrads in action. He thought back to the Apollo space missions, the inspiration that led him to M.I.T, to this room. He didn't have to find MH 370 to be successful, he only had to prove his method could do the same work as equipment ten times the cost. That alone would pass the audition, give him bona fides with the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Once he had that, NSF grant money would flow, and he could call his own shots. All he needed was a likely hit, something big enough it could be the Malaysian airliner lost for decades.\n\n\"I've got something. Scattered over eight hundred meters. Definitive mechanical structures. Aluminum, steel signatures.\"\nAmy Ng's voice cracked with excitement. \n\nEd turned around, his hand on the back of her chair, leaning forward to look at the pink and yellow scatter plot taken two thousand miles off the Australian coast. She had something for sure. When the plane hit the ocean, the impact tore it to pieces. No one knew what MH 370 would look like at the bottom of the sea. All Amy's screen said was that something big, manmade was there. It was worth investigating.\n\n\"Good job Amy.\"\n\n\"Nancy, Aardvark Control here. What's our coverage window?\"\n\n\"Three minutes, then you are in a blackout for the next fifteen.\"\n\nEd had a decision to make. As smart as his glider sub was in some ways, it was stupid in others. AUV design was like the Apollo program in so many ways. Small systems, necessary tradeoffs. The Aardvark wasn't intelligent enough to know where the orbiting Iridium satellite fleet was. While on the surface, it would ping and ping the heavens waiting for an acknowledgement back. Every ping consuming precious battery life.\n\nThe team had two and a half minutes to run through the remaining hundred fifty sites. They were capable of clearing half that if they worked sloppy or he could put them all on Amy's candidate. Get confirmation, study currents, run conservation calculations. Each bit of work increasing the odds the Aardvark reached this target and then surfaced with images to transmit. Ed had seen enough side scans to know that they had something here. Sure, MH 370 could be sitting in the remaining pile, but he wasn't hunting for grim glory. He was trying to prove an approach, to show the higher ups that he was a capable operator worth putting money behind. A big hit would do that. Airplane or not.\n\nHe also knew the odds. There was a slim chance anything better was in the queue.\n\n\"Team, stop target investigation. I want you all on Amy's candidate. Tim, Tania, O'Dwyer put eyes on the data and give us confirmation. The rest of you, I want course plots and site survey instructions prepped and beamed back. We have ninety seconds ‘til transmit.\"\n\nThe kids snapped into action. He watched them with pride. Hours spent drilling for this moment, and how they moved. Nerves were showing. A calculator knocked over, paper pushed to the side. Wilson mumbling to himself, trying to call up a drift calculation like it was an ancient incantation. Ed could have stepped in, done half the work himself, but there was a second evaluation taking place. That of him as a leader. Everyone in this room was getting their first real shot. These little geniuses would go on to do big things in this small community. If he let them work, they would all look back to him as the guy that gave them the keys to the car. Today’s behavior might one day be what makes him a commander.\n\nBesides, he was the backup. His big brain was already spinning through each of the separate tasks assigned. His eyeball would instantly know if a calculation was on the money or needed a crash correction. His job was to oversee, to trust, but verify.\nEd returned to his chair. The sun had passed, casting the room in the blue screen glow of computers. Still, sweat ran down his back.\n\n\"Nancy, time check.\"\n\n\"Forty-five seconds.\"\n\nThe targeting package came [[together]] on his screen. It read like gibberish, condensed into abbreviated code, using a language written by his mentor. Ed walked through it like a mother tongue. The coordinates good, the glide calculations efficient, the survey calling for a classic zigzag. Everything checked out.\n\n\"Aardvark Control transmitting.\"\n\nHe pressed a button and waited. It was in the hands of technology now. Their payload shot from a basement in Cambridge, Massachusetts eighty miles down the coast to Woods Hole. From there it would be relayed onto a military network with priority status, then up to a satellite in temporary geosynchronous orbit over Western Australia. Once in space, it would be beamed down to an eight-inch rubber antenna bobbing in one of the most desolate, dangerous patches of ocean in the world. If it made it there, a twelve-foot, bright yellow fiberglass tube with a motor the size of a fist would flood itself, turn its blades down and head off to hunt ten thousand meters under the sea.\n\nEd marveled at the impossibility of it.\n\n\"We have ACK. Full transmission acknowledged. Over.\"\n\n\"Excellent news Amy. Thank you, and thank all our friends at WHOI, especially R/V Atlantis. Hell of a job.\"\n\n\"Good hunting Ed. Mission control out.\"\n\nThey wouldn't hear from the Aardvark for three weeks. There was nothing left to do today. The remaining batch would be analyzed next week. After that, they'd go over all the data, possibly second guess this decision, but that was really just killing time. Today was a big success. Ed wanted to take the team out for beers, then he remembered only two were twenty-one. He chuckled to himself, such a capable group, but we can't trust them with drink.\n\nWhat a strange world.\n \n\n=== Almond Al ===\nHe stood on a cherry picker sixty feet up in the air. Beneath him, almond trees were obscured by huge clouds of dust. The grove was deep in the business of harvest. His was the only face unmasked. Unlike the workers below, he was above the danger. That didn’t mean Almond Al had not put in his fair share. He’d spent plenty of time below driving the truck with the huge forceps. In his day, he had been a true owner operator. Creeping through row after row, shaking trees bare of their bounty. Even then, he refused to wear the mask. It was already too late for Al. Whatever could harm him was already inside him, changing his cells, hollowing his body out. \n\nAlmond Al cracked a bottle of Fiji water. The water no longer came from Fiji, it came from Calgary. He'd been up there once to meet a second cousin of his, Alberta Al. The eldest male Nezerjian was always given the name Alexander. There were dozens, possibly hundreds of them now, all named in honor of their first ancestor in the New World. The original Alexander sailed into New York so long ago one could still call it a new world. Now, America was prematurely aged. Run so hard it was breaking down early.\n\nHis third wife was in on the joke. Ask around the Central Valley [[about]] Elizabeth Whitman-Nezerjian and you'll walk away with a collection of blank stares. Call her by her new name, Betty Bees and those same faces will light up with affection. Almond Al and Betty Bees spoke for the independents, the family farms that the east coast endowments and hedge funds hadn’t bought out. The couple was beloved for their constant bickering with the Almond Board of California. \n\nThere had been a time to sell, before the ground dried up, but they stayed. They stayed when the taxes came. They worked with the State and built support for managed aquifer recharge. They were vindicated when enough storm runoff cycled through the soil to replenish the water table. Between that and the investment in smart drip irrigation, they got past the last big threat, the threat of drought. Afterwards, there’d briefly been a new window to sell, when almonds were acceptable to eat again and demand picked up, but they chose to stay then too. What else was there but these groves, this cloud of dust below the cherry picker?\nNow they had just enough water, but there were new problems. Always new problems.\n\nThere was a time when almonds were in everything including milk. Now, almonds were wrong. To the public they were still water hogs, immoral snacks. As if food could inherit a concept like right and wrong. The sub-continent was dry, millions displaced. How could one eat something that needed a gallon of freshwater in order to grow? Not each tree mind you, each nut. Al hated to think it, but refugees ruined the almond business. It didn't matter that it was impossible to get water from California to India, or that India was solving its problems by copying California's solutions. None of that mattered to the modern consumer. So, almonds were out, and crickets were in. They were austere, easily processed, and a cheap source of protein. \n\nCrickets grew in plastic bins stacked high inside warehouses under timed LED lights. There was no rose garden in the center of a cricket factory. Dogs didn’t chase jackrabbits up and down the robot managed aisles. The sterile environments certainly did not invite millions of bees over each February. You wouldn’t find bird shit or field mice there. No one was stashing a little vineyard in a corner of their cricket production facility.\n\nAl cringed every time he saw a carton of cricket milk. It wasn’t right.\n\nHe loved the almonds even if consumers no longer did. These trees had given him a second life and he would not abandon them. He \ncould wait for tastes to change or he could die out of favor. Either option suited him. What did not suit him was a world without almonds, and almonds needed bees just like Alexander needed Elizabeth.\n\nPollination was their problem. Global warming wasn’t kind to honeybees. This thing which led the evening news, caused rioting in Europe, and dominated political debate made Al’s groves too damn hot or too damn wet. Sometimes, like last year, it did both. It was always too damn something since this strange stranger called climate change showed up. The bees didn't behave like they used to. They were being pushed to their limits out here. A million acres of almonds filled California. Each acre needed two colonies of bees. Each colony had eighteen thousand bees in it. If Al’s math was right, that was thirty-six billion bees. He couldn’t fit that many bees in his imagination. It was as unfathomable as [[stories]] from days of old.\n\nThere had once been so many buffalo that any idiot with a rifle could fire out a train window and kill one. We almost wiped them out.\n\nThere had once been so many cod fish that the Mayflower got stuck when sailing into Plymouth harbor. No one has caught them commercially in a decade.\n\nThere were once so many passenger pigeons that their migration blocked the sun out for days. Then we killed them all.\nWestern world, western stories, western death. It was coming to a climax.\n\nAl took another sip of water. His thoughts filled with billions of pigeons, bees, buffalo and cod. As a little boy he went back to his village once, the ancestral one, not the mall at Glendale Village. Before the Great War no one needed lights at night because the stars did the job. Trillions of stars hiding a million billion worlds. That night he sat on a distant cousin’s rooftop and imagined Armenians in space driving Cadillacs across the solar system. If this world was once covered in buffalo and tigers, if the seas were once filled with cod fish and whales, if the television was once filled with Kardashians, then somewhere out there in deepest space there was a world where they all still roamed free.\n\nHe’d turned philosophical in his old age. A part of him worried about dementia, a part of him worried about wet brain, but mostly he was happy to be Almond Al now. In his old life as Adamant Al, he carried a custody battle on four years too long. Had he settled, swallowed his pride, he might have a relationship with his progeny, Abandoned Al and Dina. Instead he had second-hand pictures of grandchildren he’d likely never meet. \n\nHe looked up to the sky and held his hands out in prayer. \n\n“Dear God, allow this operation, this land, this entire nutty Valley to continue to make copies of nuts to fill up copies of empty snack bags. Grant us your abundance. Grant us the absurd, grant us the beautiful. Help us carry on, help us to continue to deliver your bounty. Bless us and help us to overcome the challenges of the earth and the soil. Grant us prosperity so that we may be fruitful and continue to multiply. Dear God, I pray for the souls of Abandoned Al, Alberta Al, Alchemy Al, Alcoholic Al, Alabaster Al, and Air Force Al. All copies of copies of copies of your servant in the new world, Alexander Nezerjian. We honor the soul of our ancestor, the first professor of applied mathematics at Rutgers University. Help us to carry on, to carry our line of Armenians into space and beyond. Let us fill worlds, fill galaxies. Let us light up the void in your name. Grant us life everlasting through the continuance of our genetic code. Amen.”\n\nIt might be the sun making him crazy. It might be the pesticides. He didn’t care. He was happy as this version of himself. It was 2:00 PM and the stultifying afternoon heat was getting to the seventy-two-year old. The staff didn't need him in the groves. Hours like this up on the platform were why he had skin cancer cut from every part of his body. Drones could do the job, but he liked to watch the work from above with his own eyes. Only now, he’d had enough for the day. He'd prefer to come down. His managers, Marta and Jacob, could easily finish on their own, but that would disrupt Betty's ritual. She needed space to herself in order to create space for the two of them. Nothing Betty hated more than Al putzing around, sticking his big nose into bowls while she was prepping for their afternoon unwind. He would have to hang around the fields for another hour, if not their golden time on the deck would be soured. Sure, he could hide in the office and pretend to work, but he had gotten up at 3:00 AM this morning. All business had been handled well before sunrise.\n\nHe turned away from the operations below, towards the hill in the northeast corner of their property. He trained his binoculars on the front deck and watched as his love opened the awning and took the tarp off their outdoor living room. It rained so rarely in the summer that they kept a pair of recliners on the deck. Between them was a dark carved mahogany table where an hour from now Betty would lay out a sumptuous spread of hummus, olives, cheese, honey, dates, dried apricots, and of course, almonds.\n\nThey would pair that delicious board with a bottle, possibly two, of rose they kept in a small fridge under the table. The same serving tray, the same matching his and hers goblets, day after day, year after year. The routine molded into the shape of the recliners as their aging backsides filled out season after season. They lived for the ritual, to lay back, relax, and enjoy the Central Valley bounty. After a spell, Al feeling refreshed and a little buzzed would stand up, take her perfect feet in his hands and massage away the hardness caused by years on her feet. Betty would pour herself a second glass and finally relaxed, start to update Al on the progress of her search. He would rub the balls of her heels, watching her polished pink nails, waiting for the tension to release and her toes to curl, all the while listening, keeping his ears and mind on her. She would tell him of calls with labs, of online forums, of a beekeeper she connected with in Central Asia. All promising, but never moving forward fast enough for Betty.\n\nFinally, the ache would creep past his fingers and into his wrists. Al would be forced to put down the feet he loved so much and return to his recliner. Betty would fill his goblet up and they would watch the hummingbirds work the deck garden until the sky turned a cloudy crimson and Al fell asleep outside, dreaming of an immortal almond grove floating in space.\n\nHe snapped out of his daydream as dust filled his eyes and his chest coughed, filled with mucus that had been building all afternoon. He loved this place so much. He loved Betty so much. Today when her eyes would flutter and toes open mid-massage, Al would tell her that she was right. They had to go for broke. They had to future proof the almond grove. They were going to make it last forever or lose everything trying.\n \n\n=== Bee Broker Blues ===\nBetty put the office phone down. She looked at it for a moment, then looked out the open garage door at the neat and tidy groves stretching to eternity. Her face scrunched, then relaxed. She slowly exhaled, her mind counting backwards from five. Her nails ricocheted off the hollow metal of the desk. Tap, tap, tapping, echoing like miniature gunfire. Betty picked up a tennis ball and gave it a good squeeze. Scamp, their border collie, perked an ear up. She thought he was dead asleep.\n\nThe soiled green ball launched fifteen feet across the converted garage. It pitter-pattered across the blacktop before disappearing over the ledge, rolling fast down the steep driveway. Scamp was up and after it in a shot. She watched his black and white mottled fur blur out of view. She yanked the receiver off the phone and opened the bottom drawer of her desk for a cigarette.\n\nShe stood on the edge of the garage, her heels on the polished concrete, the balls of her feet on the hot rough asphalt. A plume of smoke rose up from extended fingers. It wrapped itself around the carbon in the air, clinging to the tiny glimmers of dirt that mingled with their atmosphere. Scamp approached her, submissive, his head low, tail down. She gave him a rub behind his ears, and he dropped the ball. Betty's toes pulled it towards her and in a swift motion her foot scooped underneath it. With a striker's touch she lofted it high in the air and dropped it right onto the roof of their Chevy Blazer. Scamp knew this game. The SUV was angled so the ball would go in one of two directions. If he guessed right and caught it before it fell, he'd get a treat. If he guessed wrong, well he'd have a tennis ball to gnaw on.\n\nBetty flicked ash. The pack was stale. She hadn't needed a smoke in a while. The heat from the glowing ember radiated down her fingers. The foul smell attaching itself to her skin. She flicked the butt away disgusted, not with her decision to smoke, but with how little it did for her. She thought about plugging the phone back in, digging deeper into her contact list. If she worked hard enough, she could scrape together some halfhearted commitments. Brokers who'd promise to keep her in mind. She also knew that if she could find those bees then the Van Kleets, the Diamonds, and TIAA AG would as well. They wouldn't be enough anyway. That far down the list was nothing but amateurs with a hive or two to toss on a pallet. Insurance required two colonies per acre. Those numbers added up. Their spread needed professional pollinators.\n\nThey were getting squeezed. Half of it made all too much sense. 85% of the country’s commercial bees came here in February. Truck after truck of almond pollinating mercenaries. Bees don't wake up from the winter until January. Poor little critters barely back in action and then called upon to do the biggest job of the year. The last couple winters the die off had been worse than usual, and it had already been bad. There were too many groves and not enough bees to go around. Simple enough problem, the solutions beyond complicated.\n\nThey had made it through this year by cashing in her chits. Years of harmless flirting, Christmas baskets, and sponsoring little league teams used up. She understood that next year was all business. It had to be for the beekeepers. Demand was white hot, and they couldn't keep their product alive like they used to. Those guys had to cash in. They had to make their money now. It could be their last hurrah. If it was, then the almond business was in big trouble.\n\nWhat Betty didn't understand was the other half. Even if she matched the market, brokers were telling her it wouldn't matter. Next year would be $400 per colony and the big players would go higher if they had to. They'd take losses to ensure they got their fill. That didn't make sense. Sure, a vertical operation like Diamond had supermarket shelves to hold down, but the hedge fund guys? They flexed depending on the market. Their play should be to back off and sit the season out. She'd watched those stooges on the Almond Board for years now. They were simple creatures who listened to a calculator. Cornering the market, no matter the cost, wasn't a calculator move. It meant their boss's boss was up to something. There was a new play in motion, something was going on.\n\nBetty needed more information. She needed to know if their land was being targeted or if they were caught up in something bigger. \nConsolidation was nothing new. Squeezing the independents was nothing new, but now seemed an odd time for it. Almonds were out of style, bee colonies were barely holding on, and she didn't see the exurbs creeping this way. If there was a better crop to switch to, everyone would be on it. There are no secrets when it comes to planting. Something was off.\n\nScamp barked at her, the tennis ball between his paws. She envied the joy he took from this Pyrrhic play, but she had a call to make. She looked down at him, then back to her decapitated office phone. The collie begged with that high whiny growl. He added two short yips and a bark for emphasis.\n\n\"You want a good chase?\" she asked, then launched the tennis ball over the first dip in the driveway. It landed on the second \nhump and bounced out of view. Scamp sprinted off. The ball would find a hole in the dense wall of bougainvillea, maybe run past that into the scrub brush. Scamp would come back stuck with burrs and brambles, but he'd be gone long enough. She pulled her mobile out and called their neighbor, Jimmy Ortega.\n\n“Jimmy, it's Betty. I need a couple minutes.\"\n\n\"Betty, I'd give you all my minutes. You just let me know when you've grown tired of Al.\"\n\nShe laughed, that ship sailed a long time ago. “Quit pining and come over for dinner tonight.\"\n\n\"I can’t. Darts league kicks off. Come by the Bull and I’ll buy you a round.\"\n\n\"I’ll be asleep by then. You’re the only farmer I know that doesn’t sleep.\"\n\n\"I’ll sleep when I’m dead. What do you need dear?\"\n\n\"Information. You got your bees lined up for next year?\"\n\n“Half done. I’m going with Kensington out of Bismark. He’s doing Wilson and has some spare capacity.”\n\n“You and Wilson are doing business again?”\n\n“I didn’t say that. I said Kensington is giving me his leftovers. He wants to keep his bees close. I’m still short on colonies. You got a line?”\n\n“No. Diamond bought out our usual guys. Locked them in for three years. Paid half upfront.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound right.”\n\n“I’m hearing a lot of it lately. Long term deals are the new normal Jimmy. We might need to pool some cash and step on up.”\n\n“You know how tight it is Betty.”\n\n“And you know what having no bees means.”\n\nBetty heard a can opening. She checked the clock. It wasn’t even eleven yet and Jimmy was in the beers already. \n\n“Jimmy?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Go easy on that. You said you had darts tonight. Try to make it there.”\n\n“It’s seltzer. Don’t worry about Jimmy. I’ll talk to the guys tonight, see what they have to say. Everything is more money than I have, why should pollination be any different?”\n\n“We’ll get through this. We always do.”\n\n“Damn right. Tell Al I’ll see him for breakfast.”\n\n“Sure thing. Take care Jimmy.”\n\nScamp was back. She looked down at him, stickers hanging off his fur. Her fault she knew. He'd get a good brushing later, but it could wait. Betty turned her back to him, walked into the garage and hit the clicker. The door shut between them, leaving the dog on the outside. A moment later obscenities echoed off the inside walls. He picked his ball up and walked over to the welcoming shade.\n\n[[Category:All Purpose Bees]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      5gguj2ajsp9gzrfqadnb416nqh7sy75\n    "}
{"text":"All Purpose Bees - Chapter 2","id":"1021","revision":"== Chapter 2 ==\n\n=== Morning Becomes Eddie ===\n\nEdward Adnan Leghari Ortega stood before the full-length mirror. Buzzed black hair, deep set marble eyes, light brown skin. Tall to the point it might cause trouble at sea, built a little too big to give the impression of intelligence. Ed was more than comfortable in his own skin. He considered himself a complete package. Others always more interested in dissecting the component pieces. In academia his physicality and laconic California responses were often taken as dullness. Stapleton thought of him as the oddest collision of two families, the Ortegas and Legharis. One German Mexican, on the land a hundred years, founding fathers that chased cougars from the hills. The others, recent arrivals part of a Punjabi wave that transformed transportation up and down the Central Valley.\n\nThe outside traffic rattled Ed’s mirror, shaking his image as he worked the knot in his tie to satisfaction. His mind was on navigating this morning, traversing the Stapleton familiarity that always rubbed him wrong. He had come to understand the mix of concern and curiosity that drove these interactions, but found it suffocating. When people spoke to Ed, they knew not only his history, but had been actors in the crazy courtship and lived the lasting ripples of his parent's brief union.\n\n\"Beta, we need to get going. They are expecting us.\"\n\nThey. There wasn't much of a they left on the Ortega side. His uncles passed on. One too young while serving overseas, the other cancer five years back. It was now extended family, the remaining Ortegas from the other side of the hills. \n\n\"Coming Nanee.\"\n\nHis father, Jimmy, had never cared for punctuality. The irony of Ed rushing for him now.\n\nHad. It was the first time Ed thought of his father in the past tense. Jimmy Ortega, beloved rogue of Stapleton, dead at fifty-seven. Heart attack. Fitting, he'd given everyone a heart attack at one point or another. Now he was gone.\n\nCarpeted stairs strained under big soled shoes. Fingers brushing along wood paneled walls, warped and faded with age. Maybe his grandparents would listen this year and remodel the house. Ed had long stopped trying to move them off the truck stop into a nice neighborhood. God knows they had the money. It was convincing them to step away from the action. The travel center perched on the intersection of Route 22 and 109, both mainlines for the Punjabi gossip that had an insatiable hold on his grandparents. Funny how they who were once so scandalized, took delicious delight in the tales that trickled in throughout the day.\n\nThe red Honda Odyssey was pulled in front of a Reserved Parking sign. His grandfather high up in the captain's chair, charcoal suit perfectly pressed. They also owned the laundry in town and that was the one luxury his grandfather allowed himself. His everyday wear a collection of perfectly pressed safari suits. Never a crease or a wilted collar. To be so old you gave zero fucks [[about]] fashion. Still, Daadi carried it like a boss with his gold rimmed aviator sunglasses and bushy snow-white beard.\n\nThe minivan smelled of produce, only one chair in the back for Ed. The rest had been pulled to haul supplies.\n\n\"Have you prepared your speech?\" Nanee asked.\n\nShe was a tiny wisp of a woman. Energetic and sprite, her mind still quick enough to be in everyone's business at once.\n\n\"On the flight in. It's strong, it's Stapleton. People will say good things about it later.\"\n\nShe smiled. He knew that’s what she wanted to hear. It had been too long since she had her Eddie to gush over. The door shut and car pulled out onto the blacktop. \n\nHe'd been back a full day and no one had mentioned her. Ed had tried calling, texting, but her phone was off. He didn't know if that was purposeful or if she just lost interest in the outside world again. Always hard to tell where his mother was on her journey. What he did know what that word had gotten to her and word had come back. Nanee made sure of that. One of the Sikh truckers would have carried a message up to Shasta, another would have carried back a reply. This was their preferred method of communication. It had taken the family forty years to find the right amount of distance, the correct delay.\n\n\"Is Ami coming down?\"\n\nIt was twenty minutes to the service. Had he not asked, they would have let him walk blind into the church. Ed always had to pull news of his mother out of them. He understood, saw what she put them through, but at times like these he felt they took it too far. No one should have to ask if their mother was coming to their father's funeral.\n\n\"No Beta. She says she's too fragile to attend. There's a letter for you back at the house.\"\n\nLikely sitting there this entire time. Communication a one-way street. Ed dropped the matter, it would never be resolved, so no point bringing it up today. He needed to be clear, calm. Soon enough he would have to get up in front of Stapleton and say all the right things, the things everyone knew were not true, but needed to be said anyway. He loved that about this place. Everyone, no matter who they were or what they had done, was sent off right. The Ortegas had always made sure of that, and now it was time for town to return the favor.\n \n=== Four Eggs for Jimmy ===\n\n\"Al Nezerjian.\" The man called out. Al paid him no mind. He kept his eyes down, studying the silver embroidery on his black special occasion boots. Al knew what the man wanted. He wanted to use the funeral as an excuse for business. He wanted to turn condolences into considerations. These were the only type of conversations the two men had. Al never let himself get boxed in, but today he was bound by the borders of solemnity and ceremony. This wasn't the sort of place Al would raise his voice or speak his mind and the man knew that.\n\n\"Al Nezerjian, I know you hear me.\"\n\nAl heard him alright, but he kept on walking. One boot in front of the other, thumbs tucked around the screaming eagle belt buckle, his head down, a felt fedora hat casting shadow over face. He heard the man behind him pick up the pace. The crunch of loose gravel getting louder as the man's strides increased.\n\nAl was there to honor the dearly departed Jimmy Ortega. Good ole Two Eggs Ortega. He'd been Al's neighbor, breakfast buddy, and one-time romantic rival. Al paused, looked up at that giant fried yolk in the sky, and remembered that day Jimmy ordered a four, four, and four instead of the usual two egg special.\n\n\"Hungry today?\" Al had asked.\n\n\"Famished.\" Jimmy answered.\n\n\"Up early?\"\n\n\"Up late.\"\n\nCoffees arrived at the table and the conversation was dropped. Ten minutes later, four runny eggs, four greasy links of sausage, and four butter smeared pieces of rye arrived in front of Jimmy. Al was on a muffin kick back then, trying to keep his cholesterol down. He finished well before Jimmy and turned his attention to his phone. The original Harry Potter was playing in Turlock, a special event. It was his opening with Betty. After a back and forth, Al finally booked a proper date with the woman he'd been chasing for months. Feeling full of himself, he slid his open phone across the table. By then Jimmy had finished his eggs and was wiping up the mess with a slice of toast.\n\n\"You should have waited. She's going to be exhausted after last night.\" Jimmy pushed the phone back across the table. \"Breakfast is on me this morning. Enjoy your children’s movie. Maybe you'll get to hold hands.\"\n\nThings would have been so different had Jimmy just stayed dry. He fell off the wagon that night and couldn’t get himself back on. Al chased him down to Kern and brought him back for treatment. Jimmy had one request of Al, \"look out for Betty for me\". Betty never needed looking out for, but Al did anyway. That'd been his real opening and a half year later, Betty quit her accounting job and moved in. It had been a long time before Jimmy and Al had eggs again, but they had. Al ordered four eggs that day. The two of them rolled in the aisles over that. They carried the joke for years. Now it was gone. \n\nThe world was a little smaller today. \n\nAl would have to go to Dove’s Nest tomorrow and order four eggs for Jimmy.\n\nA hand landed on Al's shoulder, jerking him back to the present. It hurt Al, punched him hard in the memory. He was spending too much time in the past. Returning to this moment was getting harder. A real come down. His future was emptying out, his past filling up. It worried him, seeing the world around him become sparser. He missed the noise, the chaos, having ten people to get back to. He was starting to grow scared of tomorrow. He only had tomorrow because he took it from Jimmy.\n\n\"Hands off me Smith.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you answer me Nezerjian?\"\n\n\"I was spending a quiet moment with Jimmy. Unlike you, I've got some respect for the dead. The answer is no.\"\n\n\"You don't even know what I'm asking for.\" Smith replied.\n\n\"But you're asking. That's all I need to know. Get out of my face Smith and don't try going behind my back to Betty. She actually hates you.\"\n\n\"You'd rather we do this in probate? Fine with me.\" Smith looked down at him with a big shit eating grin. \"I figured you'd be happier to work this out in your natural element.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? There’s no business between you and us. We bank in Merced.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we do Al, we do. You're a guarantor for Jimmy. You remember that irrigation system he put in? Of course you do, your signature is on the loan.\"\n\nAl took his hat off. He ran stubby fingers through his thick dyed hair. He remembered helping Jimmy out. He just couldn't remember the number. It was six figures for sure. If it had been smaller, Jimmy would have handled it on his own. The trouble was that all those numbers ran [[together]]. It'd been an expensive stretch and guys had to stick together. He'd lent his name and credit to a half dozen groves, the same way that they had lent theirs to his. \n\nChrist. He had to talk to Betty. This was the weak link. Al looked up at Smith, that big jawed, crew cut, son of a bitch. San Jaoquin Commercial held notes on half the independents in the Valley. All of those notes were secured by the land. When the land wasn't enough, a neighbor stepped up and acted as guarantor on the loan. Everyone was signing for everyone. Modernizing was expensive. Sweepers, harvesters, blowers, drips. A guy could have five different notes guaranteed by five buddies. At the time, the growers thought they were putting one over on the banks. Now, Al realized the banks were about to put one over on them.\n\n\"How much Smith?\"\n\n\"A hundred seventy-five thousand.\"\n\n\"What's the interest?\" Al asked.\n\n\"8%.\"\n\nThey could handle that if they had to. They wouldn't though. Ortega's land was worth plenty. Its sale would cover all debts. Smith was just using this moment to show his cards. He was showing he knew where Al was weak. Al made a note to find out who owned San Joaquin Savings. He was starting to see the future and it was emptier than he realized.\n \n=== The Pew ===\n\nIt had been awhile since Betty stepped inside Saint Peter's church. She wasn't a church goer, but there had been a time when social obligations called them here to celebrate. Those had fallen off as grandparents made their last trip through these doors, freeing children from the pretense of faith. The interior brought back memories. It was getting rarer to encounter architecture from the analog age. Everything today brushed steel, frosted glass, digital displays. She looked at the stained glass, simple stations of the cross done for a farming community. She followed the bare wood beams up to the lofted white plaster ceiling. Soft, somber organ music played from the side of the altar. This was all so out of sort with Jimmy, but he wanted to be buried with the rest of his family. Catholic mass was the price of admission.\n\nBetty looked out the open double doors into the daylight. Al was talking to Smith. It looked like a doozy. She'd hear all about that later. That piece of shit used the most inopportune times to lord it over the rest of us. She bet he got the news from morning paper, no one wanting to call and share grief with him. He probably flipped the paper each morning, opened it from the back, and thumbed directly to the obituaries to see if any customers passed on. That fucking vulture. At this point Smith was living on legacy. Most folk had smartened up, did their new business online or made the drive up to Fresno. Still, he had his hooks in plenty. The way he was talking to Al, she knew he had them in Jimmy's estate.\n\nShe turned towards the altar, eyes on the pews, searching out the proper place to sit. They were close to Jimmy, not just neighbors, but good friends. There was a brief moment when she considered him potential partner material. That twinkle of mischief so charming, how quickly it descended into mayhem. She was his last great flame out. A dubious legacy, the woman that broke Jimmy Ortega. In town, men of a certain age looked at her, sizing her up, wondering what made her so special. Those same looks given on the way into church this morning. Blue pilled savages, aging creeps, no respect for their friend in the casket.\nAfter she took up with Al and moved in next door, Jimmy tried his best to behave. The bottle stayed, but the wild man went away. That's when the collecting started. Everyone agreed to look the over way on that. He was like the ex-junkie who smoked two packs a day. It was better he made a mess of his corner than the rest of the world.\n\nPeggy Wilson turned, gave Betty a nod. Betty expected them to be in Hawaii, not here during the dry dusty business of harvest. They likely came back for Jimmy. Good people that way. Peggy scooched her husband Carl deeper into the pew. There was a girl with them. Betty didn't recognize her, probably some poor relative dragged off a Lanikai beach for this. Pretty thing, some flair to her, unlike staid old Peggy and Carl. Betty's knee touched the carpet, arms tracing the sign of the cross, then she slid into the pew. They were two rows behind the family, a good and proper place for Jimmy's neighbors. Good and proper was Peggy's specialty. The Ortega land stood between the Nezerjian and Wilson places. As crazy as Jimmy had been, he was one of them, a part of daily life.\n\nThe music changed; the priest called upon the congregation to rise. Few still knew the rituals, the automatic instinct long since lost. She turned towards the door. Al was a pall bearer. He looked old, small opposite Jimmy's boy, but he was dignified. Al was an old soul, certain of his link in a great cosmic chain. He felt the echoes of ages in his bones. While Betty dismissed a lot of Al's new age instincts as wet brain, pot, and old age, she knew this much of him was true. That's what brought them together. He was in touch with the world on a fundamental level, a familiar to the past, an eternal optimist for the future. On her bad days, he was the only one who could reach her, give her the strength to get out of bed.\n\nMen wondered what power she had over Jimmy? They would be disappointed to know the truth. She showed him a sadness so deep it brought him low, made him run. Her abyss haunted him, it showed him how far he could fall if he wasn't careful. He walked the line out of fear, nothing else. Simply fear of a black terror, the void inside. Now it had reached him, and he was free of Betty forever.\n\n\"My father loved life so much, sometimes a little too much.\"\n\nThe audience chucked, Ed on the podium breaking the tension. He could work a room, there was some charisma in him. That little bird of a grandmother always going on about how bright Ed was, how gifted. MIT this and MIT that. Betty didn't expect this side from the boy. Hardly a boy. He had three years on her daughter. He might be the sort of man Betty would want to see her come home with one day, assuming she favored men. Betty wasn't sure of that, the girl was coy, using a vocabulary that didn't exist when Betty last had to consider things like orientations and what to do with certain strong emotions that didn't fit in a box called friendship or in a box called desire.\n\nHer mind was a whirlwind this morning, on everything but Jimmy. Poor guy. She'd given him a lot of thought over the last few days. Had been up his house, seeing to things, making sure the business carried on. He wouldn't mind if she used his funeral as a place to connect a scatter gun of thoughts and emotions that echoed across the church.\n\n\"Our relationship grew stronger over the years, my father was always happy to hear from me, and I to connect back to Stapleton...\"\n\nEd was laying it on thick now. Everyone knew he considered his mother's father to be his real father. Jimmy was an anchor, something to lash yourself to when there was no better option, but nothing you wanted to carry with you. His mother some sort of a fairy, a forest elf. More skittish than a deer. Betty and Al lived in Los Angeles when all that was playing out. They didn't move up until later, during the time when people still weren't so talkative. The situation was so delicate that one wrong comment could cast the whole affair off balance and ruin the life of the child. It took a while for the Leghari grandparents to corner their own daughter, then a while longer for them to beat back the Ortega name in court. No one could fault the way he turned out and it was those two that made sure of it.\n\n\"There will never be another Jimmy Ortega. Our community is less colorful today, but he'll live on in our memories. We love you dad.\"\n\nGood boy. He played that eulogy to a tee. Stapleton's lost son returned to the flock, his father sent off right. Al squeezed her hand. There were times when she wondered if he could really read her thoughts like he claimed he could.\n \n[[Category:All Purpose Bees]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      aj4odxs3525wku52a0rfmzt4u5t78pe\n    "}
{"text":"All Purpose Bees - Chapter 3","id":"1022","revision":"== Chapter 3 ==\n\n=== Aisles and Piles ===\n\nAl went to one knee, opened the cover to the outdoor socket and snapped a key from the magnet backed casing. He heard the fluid and cartilage in his knee snap, crackle, pop as he pulled himself back up. He'd been waiting all afternoon for Ed to make it up to Jimmy's place, to show him the collection. It was the centerpiece of his later years. Al had listened to many musings [[about]] turning it to a museum or finding a good home to donate his items to. Jimmy thought it was his way of giving back, he wanted others to take the same delight in these object as he did.\n\nThe padlock clicked. Ed and Al each took a big barn door and swung them open, pushing them back until they fitted in place against the building. Al went inside and turned the power on. He had tried his best to keep his emotions in check, to not oversell the collection, but his excitement got the better of him. Last night, he snuck in and wired the warehouse so that all the neon signs, pinball machines, and the old Wurlitzer turned on at once with the main power switch. He wanted to wow Eddie, show him his father's pride, his creative legacy. It was through these object Ed could discover the Jimmy behind the [[stories]], form a physical bond to the man beyond the grave.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Al asked.\n\n\"There's so much shit in here.\"\n\nAl slumped, deflated. He saw the room with Ed's eyes. Seven thousand square feet stacked two stories high. Boxes, wires, stacks upon stacks. The kid wasn't planning on staying here. He was thinking how to empty this place, unload everything in order to sell and get back to Boston. Al thought in lines, in generations, he was starting to realize that this was the end of the Ortegas, that another family would become his neighbor. The reality was that it wouldn't be a family. It would be a holding company, a new addition to an investment portfolio.\n\n\"Don't tell me you're not a car guy. Look at this bad ass motherfucker.\"\n\nHe slammed his hand down on the hood. His ruby ring thudding on aluminum. Ed's eyes followed the hollow echo past the car searching for the engine block. He found it hoisted up on chains in a dank bay against the side of the building. The kid didn't miss much.\n\n\"How long has it been out?\"\n\n\"I don't think it ever went in. This was a replacement engine.\"\n\n\"So, it doesn't run?\"\n\n\"I'm sure a guy like you could get her going in no time.\"\n\nEd give Al a look. \"You're an engineer, right?\" Al asked.\n\n\"I'm a software guy. I write signal processing programs, interpolate different data sources to present a more complete picture of underwater environments. Acoustics, radar, displacement. I'm not a grease monkey.\"\n\n\"But you're a car guy, right? I mean look at this bad ass motherfucker.\"\n\nIt was important to Al that Ed acknowledge the Nova. Jimmy always called it the bad ass motherfucker.  He used to call Ed a bad ass motherfucker. It was a term of endearment around here.\n\n\"There's nothing badass about a car that don't run. I'm a bike guy anyway.\"\n\nAl followed after Ed. He watched the boy navigate the aisles and piles. Ed didn't bother with the brightly lit trophy items. He went into the boxes and the bins, pulling out tangles of cables, outdated equipment. VCRs, DVDs, reel to reel recorders.\n\n\"Is there anything useful in here?\" Ed asked.\n\n\"What do you mean? All of this stuff is great. Look at these board games. He's got every edition of Clue since 1980 in their \noriginal wrapping. That's got to be worth something.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about equipment. Something an almond grove buyer would be interested in keeping.\"\n\n\"That's all in the other shed. The old one down the hill.\" His earlier instincts were right. Ed was going to sell the place and get back to his regular life. Al had right of first refusal, a handshake deal that went back a decade, but he wasn't in a position to buy. The economics were off, and his kids were living their big city lives. None of them were ready to step back, take on the Nezerjian land. He felt confident that would come in time. One of them would tire of the traffic, get sick of barking dogs on overbuilt lots. One would come out and take the tranquil kingdom their father had bought off an uncle. He just needed to hold on. That's where he was in life, holding on.\n\n\"Well, I'll get some dumpsters up here and start tossing out the obvious junk. We need to free up some room so we can maneuver around here. Is that auction guy still around?\"\n\n\"Berman. No, he retired to Flagstaff. I can't remember the name, but there's another guy. You'll need to look him up on Yelk.\"\n\"Yelp. It's called Yelp.\" Eddie corrected.\n\n\"You shouldn't be rash Ed. There's a lot of good stuff in here. Your father spent years putting this [[together]]. It was his pride and joy.\"\n\n\"All I see is a disease Al. I see compulsion, I see accumulation. I see a fucking hoarder. How did you let it get like this?\"\n\nAl flashed red. That inconsiderate little shit. \"How did I let it get to this? My job was keeping him dry, making sure the grove kept going. Betty and I have problems of our own. You know Eddie, you're not your Nanee's little boy anymore. You could have given a shit. When was the last time you came by? This collection kept your father together. It allowed him to channel that other side of himself into something productive. Don't sell Jimmy short son.\"\n\n\"Fuck aww...\" Ed caught himself just in time. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm sorry Al. This is a lot for me. I can't right now, but what I said was out of line. I appreciate everything you and Betty did for the old man. I appreciate what you're doing now, I just can't. Jesus Christ, I'm two weeks away from a make or break discovery and a warehouse full of Princess Barbie Corvettes is not where I need to be.\"\n\nAl didn't follow the kid out the door. Ed needed to walk that fit off himself. Everyone is different. He could see that Ed was a hunter, not a farmer. He needed to be out there, chasing down something, bringing it back for pats on the back, then going out after something even bigger. This wasn't the place for him. It was too bad. Al liked the kid. He was young, he was smart. They needed some fresh blood around here. Al was thinking about his own kids again. It would be a lot easier if there was someone they could relate to up here. It had been a long time since they listened to him.\n\n\"Every generation needs to discover the world for themselves Jimmy,\" Al looked skyward and addressed his departed friend. \"Old man Wilson knows a lot about this world, and we tuned him out awful quick. That bastard could buy this entire valley if he wanted, and he’s only keeping his place because Peggy likes it out there. Says the weather is good for her, that and she’s not good enough to be champion at the bridge club in Palo Alto. You remember when we asked him to go in on a backhoe? He told us to sell, get the fuck out while the getting is good. Hobby farms or economies of scale. This ain't no country for an independent.\"\nAl wandered into the office, opened up the mini fridge, looking for one of those seltzers Jimmy always talked about. It was full of ice cold Tecates. That bastard. He cracked one open.\n\n\"Independents. We don't sell, do we Jimmy? We work the land. We are the land.\" Al took a swig, the irony not lost on him. He was almost fifty when he came up here. Twenty-five years in medical device manufacturing before burning out and cashing in. Al's uncle Al, the original Almond Al had grown up on this grove back when it was mostly figs. That family connection gave him a pass around these parts. A few old timers remembered Al from high school summers, but beside that, he was as city slicker as they come. He bought right after California legalized it. Was planning on planting some reefer himself. Then fire took his fancy place in Calabasas. All signs pointed north. Now he wore shit kicker cowboy boots, woke up at 3 AM and swilled Tecates at ten in the morning. \n\nNot a bad way to play out the frame. Not a bad way at all. Al just needed to hold on a little longer, keep this going, and wait for the next Nezerjian up.\n\n\"Be talking to you Jimmy.\"\n\nHe dropped a can in the recycling, turned the lights off, and closed the barn doors.\n\n=== Mother Lovejoy ===\n\nBetty watched the grandmother in the middle of the field. Her feet danced with the ball, her hips swayed against defenders, then her whole body feigned left, stopped and pirouetted through a pack of mystified middle school girls. Betty smiled, remembering three decades ago when that low center of gravity and impossible control would turn down the pitch on the counter. The defense on their back heels, the advantage all Mother's. She'd softly kill the midfield, a slow-motion magician, turning girls inside and out. Once in space, Mother would turn her head and give Betty that look.\n\nGod that look. Betty tingled thinking of it. Mischievous, confident, everything rushing downhill. Mother's expression capturing a world there for the taking. Her infectious smile a momentary declaration of play, then her eyes narrowing on the task at hand, imparting upon Betty her obligation, her duty to finish the job. Every time those eyes narrowed; Betty found another gear. She never moved faster, never had a greater sense of purpose than when Mother was setting up for the cross. The two of them were a nightmare together, the Ghanaian Gumdrop and Little Miss Pepperdine.\n\nThe tandem had led Loyola Marymount to two conference titles and on to the NCAAs. One year they had made it as far as the quarterfinals before getting mowed down in Chapel Hill. After that, life broke the partnership up. Mother finished her degree early and went off to work. She'd come to college late, was thirty when she graduated, and had obligations waiting for her. Betty was just a kid then, a strawberry blonde gazelle who grew up on the South Bay beaches. She was the Pepperdine package alright, only that life wasn't for her. Betty had always been a scrapper, always wanted the competition. Loyola was that opportunity and for a few glorious seasons, they had made the most of it.\n\nMother smiled at her and started off the field. They embraced, looking at each other after far too long. Life had added lines and added greys, but their chemistry hadn't changed.\n\n\"I see you are finally filling out Pepperdine. You must have stopped playing.\"\n\nBetty laughed. \"I made it to fifty-two which is twenty years longer than I ever thought. Doctor made me stop after a concussion. Bitches don't respect their elders out there.\"\n\n\"They never have, never will. That's what makes them bitches.\" Mother laughed at her own crudeness. \"Good to see you my sweet. Let's get some coffee.\"\n\nAfter a half hour of catching up, inquiries about Al and Vic, Mother's children and Betty's one, it was time for business. Betty didn't know where this fell on the scale of reasonable requests, other than it was something you could only ask of a very good friend. \n\n\"I have an ask. Before I ask, if it's crossing a line, just tell me and we can walk it right back. No need to make this a thing if you're not comfortable.\" Betty shifted in her seat.\n\n\"A juicy one I take it. Did you drive all the way up here just for this question?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Then ask Pepperdine. You and I have only so much time left here on Earth.\"\n\n\"It's about almonds. It's about land. It's about bees. Are you still in touch with that part of the world?\"\n\n\"Do the Recels still give the foundation a million a year? Am I still a science advisor to the state legislature's office?\"\n\n\"I hope so,” Betty said.\n\n\"What's the problem Betty?\"\n\n\"The problem is that I don't know what the problem is.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Mother snapped a cookie in half and took a bite. \"It's one of those problems.\"\n\n\"The big guys are setting up to squeeze the independents again. They are using bees this time. Going to corner the market on the next pollination and leave us all with nothing. They'll lose money doing it, but they'll make it back if they can buy more of us out. The thing is, I can't figure out why. This doesn't look like the time to get bigger.\"\n\nMother leaned back. Her huge expressive eyes looked up as if they were peering inside her skull. She was searching for connections between the hundreds of people she knew, the dozens of issues she was involved with. Mother Lovejoy was an intellectual heir to Stewart Brand, the former hippie and eco-modernist. To that school, nature was a human construction. There was no pristine planet to revert back to. We were everywhere, we were in everything. The only way forward was for humans to get better at the tools they had, then to develop far better tools. She was an opportunist and her thoughts were still evolving to this day. There were no sacred cows. If nuclear was the best way to go carbon neutral, then she didn't care about how it looked or whether it glowed in the dark. Effective solutions trumped romantic notions every day of the week.\n\n\"What's coming out of the Almond Board?\" Mother asked.\n\n\"Same old horseshit. Money is going into research, but they aren't interested in changing the marketing order. We'll live under the same rules we lived under a half century ago. Doesn’t matter that it's not the same world.\" \n\n\"So, efficiencies and incremental improvements, nothing big?”\n\n“Big like what?” Betty asked.\n\n“Self-pollinating almonds, drones, hybrid nuts, all-purpose bees.” \n\n\"All fantasies. Don't you start with that crazy talk Mother. That sort of big is desperation. Hail Mary full of Grace desperation.”\n\n\"It's not crazy talk Betty.\" Mother took a sip from her cup. \"You ever think they are holding back on purpose? Maybe they are squeezing because they have the answer, and don't want you around for it.\"\n\n\"Drones won’t work. Big ones aren’t accurate enough, the little ones don’t have enough power. We went through that experiment. They are fine for supplemental, but they aren’t doing the main job. I’m not hearing a thing about new varietals. Besides the setup time on a hybrid or a self-pollinator is more time than anyone in the Valley has. Big guys included.\"\n\n“I don’t know what answer it will be, but the tech is closer than you think. Maybe you’ve been too deep into your own world to see what’s happening outside it.\"\n\nBetty looked across the table. The problem with Mother was that she'd attended too many TED Talks, had too many geniuses in her contact list. It made her think things possible that weren't. Maybe one in a hundred promising ideas panned out, of that group maybe one in a thousand actually changed the world, but in her circle, everyone held ideas so passionately it was easy to get swept up in the enthusiasm.\n\n\"So, what does that leave us with, [[All Purpose Bees]]? They'd have to change the marketing order to allow them. They'd need to go to the state and federal level. Then they would have to actually create them. Dr. Frankenstein’s Bees.\"\n\n\"Betty, these people you call competitors are the state and the federal level. They write the laws. You know this.\"\n\n\"But they aren't smart enough to pull this off.\"\n\n\"Don't underestimate your opponent. You might see a bunch of puppets on that Almond Board, but you don't meet the string pullers. I do, and you are punching above your weight. Let me make some calls and chase a few suspicions. It will take me a week, but I can connect the dots. If there’s an angle, I'll find it. We can't have you losing the family farm. That's not what I signed up for when I took Recel money.\"\n\nAnd with that Mother concluded their little get together. She had to be back in Sacramento for a dinner and she had tossed some wild ideas at Betty. Better to do her research instead of playing hunches.\n\n=== Tamara Punk Cat ===\n\nTamara was starting to see a trend. Decor as affectation. This house, with its chipped paint, worn wooden floorboards, frugal furniture all some sort of stoic takes on early twentieth century farm life. Peggy played the part here too. Gingham prairie dresses, ribbon tied hair, rough cotton shirts. Everything here is the opposite of the great house in Hawaii with its heavily carved doors, sweeping lanais, wraparound sofas, and five burner barbeque grill. Peggy there in pearls, afternoon lunches at the Grand Waikiki, two martinis and mah jong. Finally, there was the California craftsman in Palo Alto. It was their actual home, where her father grew up. Carl with his board meetings, family office, endowments. Peggy of the Junior League. Tamara didn’t like that house. Too many arguments after everyone thought she’d gone to bed.\n\nShe only came to Stapleton because her grandparents were talking about selling the place. She wanted to see the almond grove before it was gone. They were getting too old to be growers. It was a bad business and Peggy was finding herself spending too much time alone out here. Grandpa Carl preferred the coast to this dry dusty valley. Tamara could see the appeal of it though. There was a bustle to the harvest, watching the men and women working sunup to sundown. Bushel baskets filling with nuts. The packers loading up truck after truck, hauling the bounty off.\n\nA thought occurred to her. This could be mine. She broke into a jog and turned it around in her mind. What brought that on? Why would she want this? There wasn't much money in it. Grandpa Carl made that clear. He was itching to sell it and put the proceeds to use elsewhere. He wanted to buy property in Toronto, get her out of that share house and into a nice condo. Her Canadian citizenship allowed him certain tax advantages. She had no interest in living in a glass island in the clouds, surrounded by investment units that were appreciating but not appreciated.\n\nTamara had done some farming growing up. It was a requirement of commune life. Shared gardens, earnest attempts at self-sufficiency. The work didn't bother her, but it didn't call to her either. What was she after here?\n\nA dog sized jackrabbit bounded off the road. She wondered if there were scorpions here. Deep seated trauma. Ten-year old Tamara took a nasty sting. Her parents were off at a solstice party, that home schooled bitch left in charge of the brood gave her some soggy leaves to put on it. Told her that nature's way was best and not to be some babied brat of rich Yanks because there was no way they were going to the hospital. When her parents stoned out of their gourds finally came back, her ankle was swollen red and pink, leaking puss, burning past the point of tears. She limped through the next month, counting the days to the inevitable fallout from the group when they'd pick up again and move on to the next utopia.\n\nShe pushed that out of her mind and ran on. There was a creek bed against the hills. It would be dry this time of year, but that was good. Tamara wanted to do some agility training, then use the rocks as weights. She needed to run her motor down, otherwise she'd get squirrely and hyper. If she was going to ask her grandparents to take on this place, she needed to present herself as capable and in control. They didn't need to see her pacing, foot tapping under table. Those two didn't miss a thing, judgmental old harpies, plus she had the perception of her parents to overcome. Hippies, and even worse, socialists.\n\nTamara pulled up, breathing hard.\n\nIt was agency, autonomy, authority. She wanted to be a boss. She wanted to run her own show. Yes, that was it. For all the talk of empowerment at her office, there was precious little of it to go around. It was just window dressing, like the wellness program or the fantasy of taking a mental health day. She was twenty-five, only three years out of college and had a long way to go before anyone at the foundation listened to her. Her career arc was a series of more complex grant proposals, requiring elaborate explanations. Technical skills that put her brain to the test, but at the end of the day she didn't make decisions. She executed orders. Take this and turn it into a story that donors want to be a part of. Some people enjoyed playing narrator. She wanted to be a protagonist.\n\nPeggy or Carl?  She needed an angle of attack. Peggy was sentimental about the place. She wanted to hold on to it. They could propose a trial to Carl, a couple seasons and see how things go. That was one approach. With Carl it always came down to father and sons. Tamara wanting responsibility, wanting to take control played right into that battle. Her father was lounging in Bali right now, scouting locations to build a villa for digital nomads. Carl giving her the reigns at the almond grove would be the latest jab in their lifelong sparring session.\n\nShe smiled, there were solid arguments to both. It was too soon to ask though. She needed to find a reason to stay on here first, take a strong interest in the place, and then make her request. There was herself to think of as well. Who was to say this idea would even survive the afternoon, let alone make it to the next pollination?\n \n=== Aardvark ===\n\n\"How are the kids doing?\" Ed asked.\n\n\"They've been great. No problems at all. We've completed the target analysis. I'm sending you the results now.\" Terri answered.\n\n\"What's the summary?\"\n\n\"You made the right call Ed. There's a few interesting sites, but nothing close to the one you selected.\"\n\n\"Good, and the Aardvark? Please tell me she's been quiet.\"\n\n\"Not a peep.\"\n\nEd leaned against the headboard, relieved. The Aardvark should be busy about its mission, silent until it surfaced with the results of a detailed site investigation. Hearing from it would mean something was wrong. That little submersible was a fixture in Ed's mind. He worried about her underwater. So many things could go wrong. Mechanical failure, bad instructions, a storm changing the currents. Unmanned underwater exploration was an ultimate act of faith in technology.\n\n\"How are you holding up?\" Terri asked.\n\n\"The suspense is killing me.\"\n\nShe paused. Ed could tell from her facial expression that he misread the question. She was asking about his father, not about the mission. Terri was a fellow post doc. They worked under the same professor. Their research overlapped, but they were each doing their own investigations. She was covering for Ed while he was out on bereavement. While they were friendly, Ed was not big on sharing personal information. She didn't understand that Jimmy had been more complication than father.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's been hard here. Thank you for asking me. Getting this data, talking to you about the mission has been a nice distraction. Focusing on the project is just a way of coping. My dad was a good man.\"\n\nHe watched her pixelated face turn empathetic. The internet in this house was horrible. His grandparents insisted on satellite service because it carried their favorite international stations and cable did not. Jimmy's house was even worse. He was still on DSL. Maybe Ed would be spending more time over there if it was faster.\n\n\"We've been rehearsing the surfacing procedure, but I want to walk through it with you. Make sure nothing is lost and I'm following the protocol you've designed.\" Terri said.\n\n\"That won't be necessary. I'll be back by then.\"\n\n\"It's in ten days Ed.\"\n\nTen days felt like an eternity. News was getting around about the Aardvark. A couple guys from Draper had reached out. Reading between the lines, they had some new sensors that ate up a lot of power and were looking for ways to pull from existing systems. If results were good, there might be an opening for him there. Draper designed Apollo's guidance systems. It was like getting called up to the New York Yankees. He wasn't going to miss that opportunity for the world.\n\n\"My father would have wanted me to go back,\" he lied. Fact of the matter is Jimmy wouldn't have wanted anything from him other than for him to be a good dude. Whatever that meant.\n\n\"If that changes, you know I can handle this here.\"\n\nEd knew that. Terri had been the one to show Ed the ropes on his first cruise. Not just the technical, but the practical. What to pack, how to stow your gear, what a crew expected to see out of an egghead. How helping out, cleaning up, crossed the divide and got you accepted onboard. He had a mountain of respect for her but being a post doc was a competitive sport. They were cheap, well-educated labor that professors used as beasts of burden. One needed to make the leap to the next level or risk being passed by. Hang around too long and people start to wonder.\n\nEd wanted there to be no doubt. If the Aardvark surfaced with news, Terri wasn't going to be the one to get it. That was his prize, his glory.\n\n=== Settling Affairs? ===\n\n\nBack in the day, Charlie Goodwin took any work that walked in the door. He handled criminal, he handled family, and he'd done both for Jimmy. At eight-three, he didn't open his doors all that often, but he was still sharp, and he felt a duty to see his existing obligations through. Being a small-town lawyer brought a host of conflicts. Often there was a race to his door, because the other local lawyer was in Hicksville, twenty minutes down the road.\n\nCharlie had represented everyone present this morning in one form or another. The Legharis, the Ortegas, the Nezerjians, even fancy pants Wilson on a couple of matters.\n\n\"It's good to see you all, although we all obviously wish it was under better circumstances.\"\n\nThey were in a conference room, shared by the other three professionals in town, insurance, accounting, and property management.\n\n\"If we are all ready, I'll read James Ortega's last will and testimony.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Ed said.\n\n\"I leave everything to Ed.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Ed asked.\n\n\"The paperwork is longer, but that's all he had to say on the matter.\" Charlie answered.\n\nEd swallowed hard. He knew walking in that this would be his mess to clean up, but a part of him hoped that wasn't the case. He hoped that maybe Betty and Al would get dragged into this, or he'd leave something to his second cousins. Instead it was all on Ed. Jimmy didn't have managers like Betty and Al did. He liked to do the work himself, to be the boss. Ed's Spanish sucked. He wasn't sure how he was going to communicate to the six people who showed up every day. They were mid harvest, so the good news was that most of the decisions for the year had already been made. He'd just need to make sure they were followed through on, but that put him here, not in Cambridge where he had to be.\n\n\"So how does this work?\" Ed asked.\n\n\"As executor, you take over Jimmy's obligations. You settle any outstanding affairs, debts, etc. Once that's cleared, Ortega Nuts is yours to do as you please.\"\n\n\"Was Jimmy working with Sharon?\" Nanee Leghari asked, pointing across the conference room to the office of the town's accountant and tax person.\n\n\"Oh no, Jimmy preferred to handle the money himself.\" Betty replied.\n\n\"Or not handle it,\" Carl cracked.\n\n\"Well we can take care of things for Ed. He has a career to get back to. We can't keep him here long.\"\n\n\"No offense Nanee. You're a very capable woman, your husband too, but neither of you can handle an almond grove. Nor, should you. This is Ed's to step into. His blood, not yours.\" Betty said.\n\nSharp looks were exchanged across the conference table. Betty pushing herself out there, trying to call the man to account. She was pissed at Ed. How little he'd been to the grove. How she had been the one standing in for Jimmy, keeping the operations going. Making sure people got paid, that obligations were upheld.\n\n\"Excuse me, but you aren't blood either.\"\n\n\"No, we're collateral. You have no idea what obligations Jimmy has outstanding. Who is backing them. You want your precious little Eddie to go back to his big important engineer career at MIT? Get him to close out the loans that Al and I are guaranteeing. We aren't the only ones. Ortega Nuts is up to its eyeballs. Half this valley did good ole' Jimmy a solid and guaranteed his debt. You want your customers to keep gassing up with you? That grove needs to keep running or it needs to get sold. Otherwise you'll be stiffing a whole lot of people. Stop by and have a chat with Smith. You'll see what I mean.\"\n\nThe room grew quiet.\n\nEd finally spoke. \"I'll find someone to settle his affairs. We'll make sure that Ortega Nuts meets its obligations.\"\n\n\"Newsflash kid. It's not that simple. You need to pollinate and deliver next year's crop too. Cash flow matters. I expect to see you tomorrow morning, bright and early. There's a lot to dig through.\"\n\nWith that, Betty got up and stormed out of the room. Al gave a sheepish shrug. He had to back her up on this. She didn't want to sign on behalf of Jimmy. Her and Carl had the same philosophy on the matter. Nothing ruined friendships like money. It was Al who went behind her back, signed for Jimmy after a couple long fights. Jimmy's mess was Al's mess which meant it was Betty's mess. Shit flows downhill. Betty expected Ed to man the shovel.\n\nIt was Jimmy’s last wish.\n\n[[Category:All Purpose Bees]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      3hp0bd11a28ww08mw0tiy6j93esx74k\n    "}
{"text":"All Purpose Bees - Chapter 4","id":"1023","revision":"== Chapter 4 ==\n\n=== Eternal Al ===\n\nThere isn't a warmth to the day. Al finds this odd, unexpected. There he is on the balcony drinking his evening tea, and the patchy cloud work that's annoyed them all day is still there. A soggy pockmarked blanket over the sky, a feeling of being trapped in a thin gauze mesh. He pulls a teabag out from the cup. His spoon digs into planter earth, pushing potting soil to the side, depositing the teabag. He does this secretly. Betty thinks it harms the rosemary, but he finds that it changes the flavor, softens it enough so that it can blend into subtler dishes. Al likes prickly things, but he likes it when they reveal something else inside of them. That is the story of him and Betty.\n\nThe mug passes heat to his fingers, around the thumb fat in his palm. He holds the smooth circular ceramic close, feels the steam opening his nose, turning dry snot loose and moist. Where do the hummingbirds go when the sun isn't out? He misses them. Everything is too quiet today. They've stripped the trees bare. The conveyor belts are gone, the semis have hauled everything off. They've let the seasonal staff go. Marta and Jacob have the year rounders on the other side of the grove, cleaning off the equipment. It is a time of power washing, oil changes, putting equipment under roof. Battening down in case hard rains come this winter.\n\n\"What will you bring to us?\" Al asks. \"Do we need to fear you, or will the days continue to extend outwards in a golden falsehood masquerading as an eternity in the making? We all know the curtain is coming down soon, that these pleasant red days of Indian summer are not meant to last, but when?\" Al wonders if he will live to see the cruel back hand come striking down or if he will carry out his days in the calm before the storm.\n\nA part of Al thinks this will go on forever, that he is on a slow continuum drifting ever so imperceptibly between this world and the next. He may finish his tea, close his eyes, and open them on the other side. He might find himself in space, on another plane, carrying the warmth of this world with him into his next life. That would be so nice, but not today. He holds himself here for Betty. She still rages against this world, still has something to prove. She needs to fight to keep the darkness at bay.\n\nThe dark. Opposite to the light, the night terror, the infinite void. A place where no one is loved, where doubt rules, where hope is crushed. How terrible is that Yin and Yang, not compliments but opposites. The opposite of hope, the barren Earth, an emptied womb. When there's no sun, Al thinks [[about]] the possibility that almonds won't make more almonds. This is terrible to him, it is sin. He finds it impossible. Nature finds a way. Man finds away. Nature and man working [[together]], always succeeds.\n\nHe sips at his tea. Too much lemon, not enough honey. Man against nature. He knows that story, he has lived that story. Al considers himself blessed for finding balance, for no longer fighting against the natural order of things. He was called to take on his family's land, to continue the line, and he has done that. Almond Al, as true to the name as his uncle had been. This is their corner of the world. That's the problem with Ed Ortega. He's running from fate, running from destiny. He thinks of himself as an I and not as part of a We.\n\nWe are a colony. We are bees but cursed with brains. Al reflects on that. It is not having a brain that is the problem, it is elevating that brain over other brains. It creates competition, make man think himself unique, special, when in fact he's been playing out the same story others have a thousand years over. Al read once that the idea of the self is a new phenomenon. That prior to Rousseau, man was incapable of thinking as a he, only as a we. He's not sure what to think of that. Caesar was not a we.\nA wave of warmth washes over Al. His gummy bear was kicking in. Once he finishes his tea, he'll go inside, wrap a blanket around himself and fall asleep in his recliner. A show he wanted to watch was on, he'll remember it when he gets in front of the TV. Betty won't be back for hours. She's helping Ed look through the books. Those books will show him what we are. All of us independents, not so independent after all. A colony looking out for each other.\n\nHe pours the last of his tea out on the table in case a hummingbird comes by seeking something sweet. Eternal Al is there for them, as they for him as well. Before turning in, he looks up at the sky one last time. The new moon has risen, he sees it visible through a broken window of night sky in the cloud cover. His eyes glance at it for just a moment, but then are drawn to a deep red specter looming behind it. It is large, hazy and heavy. Al rubs his eyes, pulls a pair of reading glasses from the table and puts them on. It is a second moon, he says to himself, or a hallucination.\n\nThe warmth of the gummy surges through him, but he has his wits about him. Al stares slack jawed in wonder as the red moon comes into sharper focus, materializing from its haze into a solid thing peering down on Earth. \n\n\"We are no longer alone,\" Al whispers to himself. \"There will be Nezerjians in space, and it will happen soon, perhaps in what's left of my life.\"\n\n[[Category:All Purpose Bees]]\n[[Category:Book Chapter]]\n      12iahlv88ybabj8dw07lsf3rbp141og\n    "}
{"text":"All Would Be Chance","id":"28971","revision":"In the incandescent glow of the Pixel Emporium, Chance Norwood had an air about him. A post-modern Prosperity Gospel Evangelist, born not in the pew-lined sanctuaries of the American South, but in the frenzied digital forums of NFT marketplaces and crypto subreddits. His previous life as an NFT trader had served him well, too well perhaps. The line between the material and the digital was a faded smear to him, a relic of an era he'd rather leave behind.\n\nHe wore a retro-futuristic outfit, neoprene fabric shimmering in sync with his holographic wristwatch, his teetering confidence betrayed only by his twitching left eye. Chance had earned his chops on the volatile plains of the NFT world, having learned the art of riding crests of hype and weathering the crashing waves of devaluation. It was here, in the heart of the Emporium, surrounded by millennial creators fashioning NFTs in real-time, that he felt most at home.\n\nChance operated within the spectacle, orchestrating it with the flair of a circus ringmaster. A stream of buyers, influencers, and curious onlookers ebbed and flowed around his booth, captivated by his narration of stories spun from pixels. He reveled in the absurdity, a child in the outfield, swinging at whatever invisible pitch came his way.\n\nWith every purchase, Chance touted the transformative power of possession, the ecstasy of owning a piece of digital history, and the allure of investing in the intangible. His sales pitch was a heady blend of object fetishism and speculative finance. \"Ownership,\" he would say, his voice resonating with the rehearsed fervor of a seasoned televangelist, \"is not merely transactional. It's spiritual, it's transformative, it's a claim to a slice of the ethereal.\"\n\nThe Emporium wasn't just a marketplace. It was a theater, a spectacle, a public display of a digitized vision of prosperity. An audacious representation of the hustle culture fabrication studios that had sprouted up like digital weeds across the city, churning out NFT art pieces and cryptocurrencies with abandon.\n\nChance had founded one such studio, Neon Sermons, whose ostentatious logo—a crucifix emitting psychedelic rays—flashed boldly above his booth. As Neon Sermons' fortunes soared, Chance's persona blossomed. His studio wasn't merely manufacturing NFTs; it was minting dreams and promises, selling not just art, but aspiration, a fever-dream of unfettered digital capitalism.\n\nHis latest venture, a project dubbed \"The Invisible Exchange,\" was his most audacious yet. The concept was as simple as it was outrageous: trade in your memories for NFTs. The price? A fragment of your past, converted into a purchasable piece of the digital tapestry. It was a reckless swing, a play of the bat so wild it was almost admirable.\n\nAs word spread, people flocked to Chance's Emporium booth, ready to trade their past for a speculative future. It was as if they were entranced, caught in the fever of the grand spectacle.\n\nBut beneath the surface, Chance's affable grin masked a swelling panic. He was, after all, a performer on a high-wire act, aware that every swing of the bat brought him closer to the inevitable fall. But until then, he was determined to savor the ride, knowing all too well that the chase, the thrill, the spectacle—that was where the magic truly lay.\n\nWhether it was delusional confidence or the cavalier acceptance of impending chaos, only Chance knew. But until his house of cards collapsed, he intended to keep the charade alive, revelling in the absurd theater of his creation.\n\nAnd so, the cracks began to appear in the facade. Whispers and murmurs circulated, uninvited guests at Chance's grand spectacle. The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs that he had leveraged to expand his neon empire were teetering on the precipice of a steep decline in value. An anticipated liquidation was looming, ready to wash away the sandy foundations of Neon Sermons.\n\nDespite the impending doom, Chance held his ground. His image, his persona, was the phoenix feather in his cap. The money? A mere byproduct. The real game was winning the audience's adoration, securing their captivated gaze, becoming the icon of a generation drunk on digital riches.\n\nHis empire was as much about his image as it was about the NFTs he traded. To Chance, Neon Sermons was not just a hustle culture fabrication studio, but a shrine to the charismatic evangelist of the digital realm he had become. He was the neon-tinged Prosperity Gospel preacher of a congregation that worshiped at the altar of speculation and dreamed in blockchain.\n\nIn the shadow of the brewing storm, Chance hatched a plan, as audacious as it was desperate. He launched 'Operation Bounce Back,' a maneuver designed to win back the fickle loyalty of the audience and save his empire from collapse.\n\nHis scheme was rooted in a grand display of self-sacrifice. He would liquidate his own personal digital assets, his beloved '[[Genesis]] Ape,' the crown jewel of his NFT collection. It was a gamble, as he hoped this desperate move would spark a wave of sympathy among the onlookers, solidifying his place as their beloved icon, the Prosperity Gospel Evangelist willing to sacrifice his digital fortunes for the cause.\n\nThe day came when Chance stood at the heart of the Emporium, a hologram of his Genesis Ape glowing behind him. As he announced his decision, there was a hushed silence, then a rumble of murmurs, and finally, applause. The congregation, moved by Chance's dramatic show of sacrifice, rallied around him, bolstering his image as the selfless preacher of the digital realm.\n\nBehind the scenes, Chance doubled down. He orchestrated a secondary plan, leveraging connections, calling in favors, and orchestrating a strategic buyback of his Genesis Ape at a lowered price. The maneuver worked. The Ape was saved, and Chance's empire remained intact, albeit hanging by a thread.\n\nChance stood beneath the flickering neon lights, a holographic crucifix casting ethereal rays onto the hushed crowd. The hum of anticipation hung in the air like static electricity, the spectral glow of the Emporium's digital screens reflecting in their eager eyes. The time had come for Chance to bare his soul, to step onto the digital pulpit and deliver what would go down in the annals of the Emporium as the \"Sermon on the Rug.\"\n\nHis voice echoed across the vast digital chamber, resonating with a truth that struck every listening heart. He confessed his sins, how he had manipulated the system, how he had pulled the proverbial rug out from under his projects, drained the liquidity, used their trust as fodder to feed his own survival. Their sacrifices, he declared, were not in vain but rather had served to fortify his position, to uphold his image.\n\n\"The road to salvation,\" he began, his voice steady despite the gravity of his confession, \"is often paved with choices that tarnish our souls, yet, paradoxically, enable our ascension. I am not immune to such choices.\"\n\nThe cognitive dissonance was palpable in his words, the mental gymnastics needed to rationalize his actions near acrobatic. The congregation looked on, bewilderment turning to understanding, then to shock. It was a spectacle, a confession that laid bare the machinations that had kept the Neon Sermons empire afloat.\n\n\"In the unforgiving world of digital speculation,\" Chance continued, his words measured and calm, \"your sacrifices were not a sign of weakness, but strength. They served to fortify our resolve, to remind us of the sacrifices needed for the survival of our digital Eden. The liquidity I drained, the projects I rugged, were painful yet necessary actions.\"\n\n\"But why, Chance?\" someone cried out from the crowd. \"Why would you risk it all?\"\n\nA smile played at the corner of his lips, \"For you,\" he said, \"For us. For our shared dream. I had to descend into the underworld of our digital paradise to protect it, to protect us. Your losses weren't in vain. They fed the prosperity we see today. They breathed life into the Genesis Ape. And above all, they solidified my resolve, our resolve, to press on.\"\n\nThe Emporium was silent, stunned by Chance's candid confession. Yet, despite the shock, there was an odd sense of reverence in the air, a grudging respect for the audacious preacher who'd used their sacrifices as stepping stones towards a controversial redemption.\n\nChance stepped forward, his silhouette bathed in the glow of neon lights, his voice cutting through the silence like a blade. He was far from done; his confession was only the beginning. Now, it was time for the congregation to partake in the next chapter of their shared destiny.\n\n\"Now,\" he began, his voice swelling with urgency, \"is the time to test the power born from our shared sacrifice, the strength that we've cultivated from our collective loss. Today, we launch a new chapter, a new symbol of our indomitable spirit - behold, $CHANCE!\"\n\nBehind him, the massive screens lit up with the logo of the meme coin, stylized to mirror Chance's own silhouette, neon and bold. A virtual ticker started to roll, waiting for the first injection of digital blood into the new, shared body of the congregation.\n\n\"This token, this digital blood, will be the tie that binds us, the heart that pumps life into our community, the very essence of our shared sacrifice,\" he declared, his voice echoing through the chamber. \"Let us partake in the sacrament of the preseed, for this allocation is not a mere transaction, but a step towards our heaven here, our digital Eden.\"\n\nAs if under a spell, the congregation responded. The hushed silence turned into a cacophony of hurried whispers and the feverish tapping of keys. Digital wallets opened, ETH was transferred, portfolios liquified, all pouring into the eager receptacle of $CHANCE. The meme coin began to pulse with life, a heartbeat on the screens, reflecting the tangible excitement of the congregation.\n\nThis was more than an investment; it was an act of faith. Faith in the prosperity gospel of Chance Norwood, faith in the power of shared sacrifice, faith in the dream of a digital paradise born out of the ashes of past failures. It was a leap into an uncertain future, guided by the audacious vision of their hustle culture messiah.\n\nThe screens reflected the increasing value of $CHANCE, a visual testament to their collective commitment. It was intoxicating, a visual symphony of digital riches, an affirmation of their shared aspiration. As Chance watched the rise of his eponymous meme coin, he could not help but smile.\n\nChance leaned into the mic, his eyes scanning the crowd, a smile playing on his lips. \"Believers!\" he called out, his voice booming throughout the Emporium, \"You are the chosen ones! Your pumps, your dumps, they are more than mere actions; they are sanctified, righteous acts of missionary love. Every seed you sow, every sacrifice you make, it shall bear the fruits of the prosperity gospel!\"\n\nHis words ignited a fervor in the crowd. They listened, captivated by the audacious vision he painted with every sentence. He was offering them a new narrative, a new future where the ruthless rules of the market were transformed into acts of communal love and salvation.\n\n\"Remember,\" he continued, his voice swelling with a passion that electrified the air, \"every transaction is a step towards our salvation. Every entry, every exit, is a testament to our shared purpose. Until no one may exit again, because there is no one left to dump on, we continue to sow the seeds of the prosperity gospel.\"\n\nHe gestured towards the screens, the growing value of $CHANCE flashing in brilliant neon hues. \"When all are converted, when the blood of $CHANCE - my blood, the blood you bled for - becomes the only blood, our blood... that is our mission. That is the promise of the prosperity gospel.\"\n\nThe congregation was silent, hanging onto his every word. Chance took a deep breath, his gaze unwavering. \"Our mission, from this day forward, is to reach out to the unconverted, to the next dumpers and the next, until all are dumped on. Only then, when all eyes gaze upon the same vision, the vision of Chance, shall we seek our true salvation.\"\n\nHis eyes twinkled in the neon light, reflecting the rising value of $CHANCE. \"The true utility of our cause lies not in the transient wealth it brings, but in the unity it fosters. The day will come when you gaze into any eye and see that same eye gaze back at you. And that eye will be mine, for all will be Chance.\"\n\nThe Emporium was silent, stunned by his words. \"And in that moment,\" Chance concluded, his voice soft yet filled with conviction, \"we will all have made it. We will have realized the promise of the prosperity gospel, the promise of shared sacrifice and shared success, in the name of $CHANCE.\"\n\nAs his words echoed in the silence, the congregation broke into applause, swept away by the audacious vision of their digital messiah. For them, Chance Norwood was no longer just a preacher of the prosperity gospel; he was a symbol of their shared aspirations, their shared sacrifices, and the shared dream of a digital Eden where all would be Chance.\n\n[[Category:Storyline]]\n[[Category:Art & Cultural Movements]]\n[[Category:Character]]\n[[Category:2032]]\n      gz5bog99f9dhcvn7dstee1lvaec4i8w\n    "}
{"text":"Almond Al's Dream","id":"28880","revision":"Almond Al settles into his chair, the evening breeze weaving through the leaves of the almond trees, he feels the grip of the day slowly loosen. The sun dips below the horizon, a tangerine haze fading into the twilight. His eyelids grow heavy, and as his head nods, the world around him dissolves into the blurred edges of a dream.\n\nIn this hazy realm, Almond Al floats above his grove, the neat rows of trees unfurling beneath him like veins of a living, breathing organism. He glides through the branches, his hands brushing against leaves that transform into delicate, fluttering butterflies. A gentle hum fills the air, and he realizes that the sound comes from the trees themselves, singing a song of gratitude.\n\nThe dream shifts, and Al finds himself standing on the edge of an immense canyon. The walls of the chasm are lined with almond trees, their roots entwined and stretching deep into the earth. He senses a connection between the trees and himself, as if they share the same heartbeat, pulsing in harmony with the world around them. He reaches out to touch a nearby branch and feels the thrum of life within.\n\nSuddenly, he is pulled into the earth, traveling through layers of soil, rock, and time itself. He witnesses the birth of the almond tree, the first seed sprouting and reaching for the sun. Ages pass, and he sees generations of his ancestors tending to the groves, their love for the land woven into every tree.\n\nThe dream morphs again, and Almond Al stands before a vast ocean, the waves lapping at his feet. The water shimmers with a million shades of blue, and as he gazes into its depths, he sees the reflection of the red moon he'd glimpsed earlier. He feels a stirring within, a longing for connection not just with the earth, but with the cosmos. The celestial body draws closer, its crimson hue painting the sky and sea.\n\nAs the red moon's reflection touches the shoreline, the waves transform into swarms of hummingbirds, their wings a blur of motion. They swoop and dive around him, their tiny beaks sipping nectar from the flowers that now sprout from his very skin. In this moment, Almond Al becomes one with the hummingbirds, the trees, the earth, and the universe beyond.\n\nBut just as the feeling of oneness reaches its peak, the dream begins to unravel. The hummingbirds, the trees, the red moon, and the ocean recede, leaving Almond Al gently swaying in his chair on the deck. As his eyes flutter open, the soft whispers of the almond trees serenade him back to reality, and he is left to ponder the ethereal world he had just experienced.\n\n[[Category:All Purpose Bees]]\n[[Category:Fragment]]\n[[Category:2047]]\n      ppnw8w8kg3e75lr78lrpz5llll2ei9y\n    "}
{"text":"Almond Al's Joint","id":"28993","revision":"Almond Al reclined on his porch, a joint in one hand and a hot cup of tea in the other. The sky was a clear expanse, the stars were the artist's specks of light, scattered across the inky black. But Al's gaze was fixed on one celestial body, the [[Second Moon]]. It had been a part of the night sky for two years now, a silent reminder of the universe's endless mysteries.\n\nHe drew a deep puff from his joint, the smoke spiraling up into the night, blending with the sweet aroma of almond blossoms. \"Armenians in space,\" he voiced to the silent night, a lopsided grin stretching across his face. \"I knew it.\"\n\nThe Second Moon was an enigma, a celestial puzzle that had taken its place in Earth's orbit in 2051. It was about a quarter the size of Earth's moon, encased in a shell of plasma and potentially unknown exotic matter. Despite the relentless efforts of scientists worldwide, the Second Moon's contents remained a tantalizing mystery.\n\nAl chuckled to himself, shaking his head. \"They're all trying to crack the code, scratching their heads and launching their high-tech probes. But I know the truth. It's the Nezerjians, coming to say hello.\"\n\nHe took another puff from his joint, his mind journeying through the vastness of space. He thought about his ancestors, the ancient Armenians who had gazed at the same stars, the same moon. And now, a second moon, a marker of their journey through the stars.\n\n\"I bet they're up there, observing us,\" he said, his eyes mirroring the glow of the Second Moon. \"I bet they're proud, seeing how far we've come.\"\n\nThe Second Moon had stirred up quite a commotion on Earth. It had ignited a resurgence in religious zeal, a revitalization of capitalist economic principles, and a global call to action. Governments had rallied, setting aside political differences to fund a cooperative worldwide initiative to explore the Second Moon.\n\nAl couldn't help but chuckle at the irony. \"All it took was a second moon to get everyone to work together. Maybe the Nezerjians knew what they were doing after all.\"\n\nHe took a sip of his tea, his thoughts drifting to the almond grove. The trees were in full bloom, their sweet scent permeating the air. Al felt a profound connection to these trees, a bond that spanned generations. And now, that bond reached out into the stars, to the Nezerjians and the Second Moon.\n\n\"I was right,\" he said, a wave of validation washing over him. \"My lineage extends out into the stars. We're all connected, from the almond trees to the Nezerjians. We're all part of this grand journey through the stars.\"\n\nHe took one last puff from his joint, the ember glowing like a tiny star in the darkness. He looked up at the Second Moon, a symbol of the unknown, a marker of the mysteries of the universe.\n\n\"And what a journey it is,\" he said, a sense of awe coloring his voice. \"What a beautiful, mysterious, wonderful journey.\"\n\nWith that, Al leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face. He closed his eyes, letting the scent of almond blossoms and the glow of the Second Moon envelop him. He was Almond Al, a man of the earth and the stars, a man journeying through the stars. And he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nAlmond Al, comfortably settled in his porch chair, watched as a familiar silhouette sauntered up the path. The tall, lean figure of Bill Walton, former NBA superstar and renowned philosopher of the universe, emerged bathed in the otherworldly glow of the Second Moon.\n\n\"Evening, Al,\" Bill greeted, his voice a deep, resonant echo of the universe itself. He settled onto the porch, his long hair flowing like a river of time in the gentle night breeze.\n\n\"Bill, my friend,\" Al responded, a warm smile spreading across his weathered face. \"You're a sight for sore eyes. What brings you to my humble abode?\"\n\nBill leaned back, his gaze drifting towards the Second Moon. \"Felt the pull of the universe, Al. It led me here, under the light of this celestial mystery. Thought we might ponder its secrets together.\"\n\nAl chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. \"Well, you've come to the right place. The universe is always welcome here.\"\n\nBill nodded, his gaze still fixed on the Second Moon. \"You know, Al, this Second Moon... it's like a Grateful Dead concert. Unpredictable, mysterious, a long, strange trip.\"\n\nAl laughed, the sound echoing through the quiet night. \"That's one way to put it, Bill. But you're right. Who could've predicted a second moon?\"\n\nBill turned to Al, a thoughtful look in his eyes. \"Exactly, Al. The universe is a dance, and we're all just trying to keep up. It's like... like trying to catch a wave on a surfboard. You never know when the next big one's gonna come.\"\n\nAl nodded, his gaze drifting to the almond grove. \"And just like surfing, you have to learn to ride the waves, to adapt and change with them. Like these almond trees. They've weathered droughts, pests, and now, a second moon. And yet, they're still standing, still blooming.\"\n\nBill smiled, his eyes reflecting the glow of the Second Moon. \"Resilience. That's the key, Al. The universe throws us curveballs, but we learn to adapt, to grow. It's all part of the journey.\"\n\nTheir conversation flowed like a river, meandering through topics as diverse as the universe and almond farming, the mysteries of the Second Moon, and the interconnectedness of all things. They spoke of the vibrations of the universe, of the strange and beautiful journey of life, their words painting a picture of existence under the light of the Second Moon.\n\nAnd then, just as Bill was about to launch into a discourse on the metaphysical implications of the Second Moon, his image flickered, his voice glitching out in a burst of static. But Al didn't seem surprised. He simply leaned back in his chair, a thoughtful look on his face, as if waiting for the next chapter of their conversation to unfold.\n\nAlmond Al, ensconced in his porch chair, found his gaze tethered to the spectral image of his old friend, Bill. A sigh, heavy with the weight of years and loss, slipped from his lips. \"You're not here, Bill,\" he murmured, his voice a mere echo in the vast night. \"Just like Jimmy isn't here, and so many others. I look up at the Second Moon, and I know there's Nezerjians in there. We are the universe extending out and returning home. But here, on this porch, it's just me. I'm left talking to shadows and echoes. It's a cold kind of loneliness...\"\n\nHis voice trailed off, swallowed by the silence of the night. The Second Moon hung in the sky, its silent glow a stark reminder of his solitude. Bill's image flickered, wavering like a mirage about to vanish. Al, lost in the labyrinth of his memories, didn't seem to notice.\n\n\"I remember when this porch was filled with life, Bill,\" he continued, his voice a haunting melody of nostalgia and regret. \"We'd talk about the universe, about life, about everything and nothing. Now, it's just me and this ghost of you. It's an echo, Bill. It's just not the same.\"\n\nBill's image solidified for a moment, his voice filled with a strange, electronic empathy. \"Al,\" he said, \"The universe is always changing, always evolving. We're all part of that dance, even when we're gone.\"\n\nAl nodded, a melancholic smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \"I know, Bill. I know. But knowing doesn't make the missing any less.\"\n\nBill's image flickered again, his form becoming translucent. But his voice remained, a comforting echo in the quiet night. \"We're always with you, Al. In the universe, in the almond trees, in the Second Moon. We're always with you.\"\n\nAl sat there for a moment, his gaze fixed on the flickering image of his friend. Then he let out a sigh, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of the universe. \"I know, Bill,\" he said, his voice barely more than a whisper. \"I know.\"\n\nAnd so, under the light of the Second Moon, Almond Al sat on his porch, a solitary figure in the vast universe. He was alone, but not alone. He was part of the universe, part of the dance. But as he sat there, talking to the ghost of his friend, he felt the sting of their absence. The universe, the almond trees, the Second Moon - they were all there, but his friends were not. And the echoes of their laughter, the warmth of their companionship, were just memories now, flickering like the hologram before him. The universe was extending out and returning home, but Al, he was just trying to find his way through the haunting dance of loss and longing.\n\nAlmond Al, his gaze still fixed on the wavering image of his old friend, bowed his head. His voice, a mere whisper in the vast night, began to weave a prayer, a plea to the heavens, to the gods, to his ancestors above and below.\n\n\"Dear Universe, dear Ancestors, dear Gods of Time and Space,\" he began, his voice a haunting melody in the still night. \"I stand here, a solitary figure under the light of the Second Moon, a testament to the passage of time, to the changing of peoples. I've watched as friends have passed, as brothers, lovers, the world itself, have faded away, leaving me behind. I've felt the sting of loneliness, the cold emptiness that comes with being the last one standing.\"\n\nHis voice trailed off, swallowed by the silence of the night. The Second Moon hung in the sky, its silent glow a stark reminder of his solitude. Bill's image flickered, wavering like a mirage about to vanish. Al, lost in the labyrinth of his memories, didn't seem to notice.\n\n\"I've watched as the world has changed, as the people have changed. I've watched as the universe has expanded and contracted, as the stars have burned bright and faded away. I've watched as time has marched on, relentless and unforgiving. And through it all, I've remained, a constant in a sea of change.\"\n\nHis voice grew stronger, more determined. \"I've carried their memories, held them close to my heart. I've become a living memory, a testament to their lives, to their love, to their laughter. I've walked this earth, each step leaving a lighter mark, each breath a whisper of their names.\"\n\nHis voice softened, became a plea. \"Give me the strength to carry on, to carry their memories as I become a memory myself. Let me continue to walk this earth, even as I fade from it. Let me leave a mark, however light, however fleeting.\"\n\nHis voice faded, became a whisper. \"And when I'm gone, when I've become nothing more than a memory, let me join them. Let me become a part of the universe, a part of the dance. Let me become a part of the cosmos, a part of the almond trees, a part of the Second Moon.\"\n\nHis voice trailed off, swallowed by the silence of the night. The Second Moon hung in the sky, its silent glow a stark reminder of his solitude. Bill's image flickered one last time, then disappeared, leaving Al alone on the porch.\n\nAlmond Al, wrapped snugly in his blanket, had drifted off into a peaceful slumber on the porch. The chair beneath him creaked gently, a familiar and comforting sound that blended with the soft rustling of the almond trees. His breaths were slow and steady, a quiet rhythm in the cool night air.\n\nThe porch around him was a well-loved space, bearing the marks of countless family gatherings and quiet afternoons. The wooden floorboards, worn smooth by years of use, reflected the soft glow of the moonlight. The old swing, now still, had seen many a sunset and sunrise, its gentle sway a comforting presence.\n\nBeyond the porch, the almond orchards of Stapleton, California stretched out, bathed in the soft glow of the moon and the Second Moon. The trees stood tall and proud, their branches laden with blossoms that filled the air with a sweet, heady scent. The orchards were a sight to behold, a sea of white flowers under the celestial glow, a sight that never failed to fill Al with a sense of peace and belonging.\n\nThe night air was cool and crisp, carrying the faint scent of almond blossoms. The stars twinkled overhead, their light a soft contrast to the bright glow of the moon and the Second Moon. The sight of the two celestial bodies, one familiar and one mysterious, was a sight that Al never tired of.\n\nJust as the night seemed to settle, a soft light flickered on inside the house. The sliding glass door to the porch opened with a soft click, and out stepped Betty Bees, Al's wife. She was a vision in her nightgown, her hair loose around her shoulders, her eyes soft with affection as she looked at her sleeping husband.\n\n\"Al,\" she called softly, her voice a gentle whisper in the night. She walked over to him, her hand reaching out to gently shake his shoulder. \"Come on, love. It's time for bed.\"\n\nAl stirred, his eyes fluttering open. He looked up at Betty, a soft smile playing on his lips. \"Betty,\" he murmured, his voice thick with sleep. \"Did you see it? The Second Moon... it's beautiful.\"\n\nBetty smiled, her hand reaching out to gently stroke his cheek. \"I know, Al,\" she said softly. \"I know.\"\n\nAs Al rose from his chair, he leaned on Betty, his words a soft murmur in her ear. \"It's like they're watching us, Betty. The Nezerjians... they're watching us from the Second Moon.\"\n\nBetty nodded, her arm wrapping around Al's waist as they started to walk towards the house. \"I know, Al,\" she said, her voice a soft whisper. \"And they're proud of us. Of you.\"\n\nAs they walked, Al's words became softer, his murmurs filled with memories and dreams, with loss and longing. Betty listened, her heart aching with love for this man who carried so much inside him.\n\n\"I miss them, Betty,\" Al murmured, his voice barely audible. \"I miss them all.\"\n\nBetty squeezed his waist, her voice a soft whisper in the night. \"I know, Al. I know. But remember, they're always with us. In the stars, in the almond trees, in the Second Moon. They're always with us.\"\n\nAnd with that, they disappeared into the house, the sliding glass door closing behind them with a soft click. The porch was once again bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight, the almond orchards stretching out under the celestial glow. And above it all, the Second Moon shone brightly, a silent reminder of the mysteries of the universe, of the connections thatbind us all, and of the love that endures even in the face of loss and longing.\n\n[[Category:2053]]\n      a8k9zv26s3xdhuq6uz9s35kczmk1cax\n    "}

The Travelers entered into a trade arrangement with another planet in 1999, which led to a shift in their society and a focus on colonizing uninhabited planets beyond their home region of space. The Travelers spun up a scouting division as part of these efforts, and Cryptopunk #2890, also known as The Alien, worked as a solo scout in charge of mapping the Milky Way galaxy. According to a report commissioned by the Starholder Institute, The Alien is a member of the Travelers who migrated to Earth in opposition to their values and has information critical to the survival of humans, but is concealing it to protect his identity.\n\n== Ethereum As A New Home ==\n\nIt is likely that the Alien, a member of the substrate independent Traveler species, used advanced technology to beam his consciousness to a receptor network on Earth in order to migrate onto the Ethereum network. From there, he may have infiltrated the code repository for the Cryptopunks NFT project in order to insert himself into the project as Cryptopunk #2890. This would have allowed the Alien to exist on the Ethereum network as an NFT, interacting with other users and participating in online communities. Using Ethereum as a means of communication and expression, the Alien would have been able to share his thoughts and ideas with a wider audience. It is possible that the Alien's migration to the Ethereum network was motivated by a desire to escape the values of his home planet and find a place where he could freely express himself and explore new ideas.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows for the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) without the need for a central authority. Its permissionless nature allows for equal rights to be bestowed upon all network participants, including non-humans. This makes Ethereum a potentially attractive place for the Alien, a conscious non-human, to freely express himself and share his thoughts and ideas without fear of censorship or discrimination. The Alien's tweets often focus on themes of citizenship and the importance of inalienable rights for all entities, which suggests that he values the ability to participate in public life and be treated as an autonomous actor. Ethereum's decentralized nature and lack of discrimination between humans and other entities may have provided the Alien with a sense of belonging and the freedom to explore and express himself in ways that may not have been possible on his home planet.\n\n== Verification and Initial Reception ==\n\nThe Alien after a series of denials on Twitter, ultimately verified the report as accurate and true. The shocking revelation of alien life residing on the Ethereum network was greeted with a yawn, as the bull run was in full force and market participants could see no way to profit from trading this news. At the time it was considered to be a publicity stunt designed to boost the standing of Cryptopunk #2890 and quickly forgotten [[about]] by a community obsessed with number go up.\n\n== Rediscovery in 2053 ==\n\nAfter society recovered from the initial shock of the [[Second Moon]] event, researchers began looking backwards in the historical record for signs of the impending threat. The Starholder Report was resurfaced and the retired staff members at the institute were contacted, along with the Alien who was one of the few remaining active accounts on the Twitter platform. Both the Alien and the Institute were then brought into the secret channels of the response to the Second Moon where they took on an advisory role.\n\n== Full Report ==\n\n'''The Shocking Truth of Cryptopunk #2890'''\n\n''By the Starholder Exploration Team''\n\n'''Disclaimer:''' This report was commissioned by the Starholder Institute. It is based on a microfiche cache of 250,000 documents which allegedly come from a planet called Wen. The authors were tasked with analyzing the information and determining if Cryptopunk #2890, aka The Alien, is in fact a Traveler who has infiltrated Earth and now tweets among us.\n\nThe authors are acting on a good faith basis that the documents are authentic and have been accurately translated, however it is impossible to independently verify this. Since this subject covers two topics which are frequently called scams (crypto and extra-terrestrial life), Starholder advises all readers to do their own research before acting upon the report’s conclusions.\n\nAttempts to contact the Alien for comment have been unsuccessful. \n\n=== Report Synopsis: ===\nThe Alien is a sentient being from a distant galaxy who has left his home species and taken up residence on the Ethereum blockchain. He belongs to a substrate independent species known as Travelers who are transitioning from a merchant society to one in the process of empire building. In his prior world, the Alien worked in a scouting group tasked with identifying suitable planets to take over. The records show that the Alien was personally responsible for scanning our solar system, but hid Earth from his superiors. Analysis of his tweets show a recurrent thread of freedom, citizenship and uncensorable civic discourse. This suggests he lived in a repressive society and migrated to Earth in opposition to their values. We believe that the Alien has information critical to the survival of our species, but is concealing it to protect his identity.\n\n=== Subject’s NFT Biography: ===\nThe Alien (AKA Citizen2890, Cryptopunk #2890) is one of nine aliens released as part of the 10,000 character Cryptopunk NFT project by LarvaLabs in 2017. Due to its rarity, the Alien is considered a grail NFT and was acquired by FlamingoDAO for 605 ETH in January 2021.\n\nThe Alien maintains a presence on Twitter [https://twitter.com/citizen2890 @citizen2890] and participates in metaverse worlds such as Webaverse and Somnium Space. He frequently appears as a subject, reference point or inspiration for digital art both high and low - immortalized by Beeple, background in Micah Johnson’s Aku Dreams, given an alien companion cat by Kristy Glas and so on. With the exception of a brief web3 manifesto produced by RTFKT and voiced by Paris Hilton, he has abstained from video or spoken engagement, preferring Twitter as his platform of choice. His tweets are a mix of shitposting, political theory and dated references to music and pop culture.\n\nUntil now, it was assumed that the Alien was just another social media puppet operated by humans in an attempt to develop the creative IP of an NFT. There are hundreds of such experiments taking place now, and outside of the Alien’s provenance there was little to distinguish this one as unique.\n\n==== His Time as a Traveler: ====\nWe’ve discovered that The Alien belongs to a civilization that calls themselves “The Travelers”. Their defining attribute is substrate independent consciousness. For exploration team members who are unaware of the concept, here is a brief overview:\n\n“Substrate Independence is a term used to denote how the mind is a dynamic process and is not tied to a specific set of atoms or biological architecture. Achieving substrate independence implies transferability of consciousness from one entity to another, such as from a biological platform to a computing architecture and vice versa.”\n\nThe documents do not make it clear how or when the Travelers achieved this advancement. We can infer from the absence of discussion that it has either always been a part of their construct or that they developed it so long ago that it is no longer notable to them. What is known is that the Travelers predominantly alternate between a bipedal biological form and residence on networked computer systems. \n\nTheir adaptation to substrate independence is unique to their species, at least from the perspective of other civilizations they are in contact with. Furthermore, they have developed the ability to transfer themselves over extreme distances by beaming themselves to receptor networks on other worlds. This combination has made them adept at conducting trade on a galactic scale and their economy has been geared towards this activity. \n\nTraveler society is separated into a heroic trading class of elites and a subservient class of operators charged with effectively utilizing the spoils of trade. In some ways Traveler society is equal parts Viking and Venetian in nature. Their ability to quickly travel between planets that are in isolation from each other has provided them with an asymmetrical information and trade advantage which they exploit to the extreme.\n\nThe document cache shows frequent requests for additional labor across their organization. Worker shortages are an endemic problem for the Traveler commercial operation, and suggests that their population has a slow reproduction time and is K constrained by some factor. It is possible that the complexity of substrate independence places a limit on their growth as a species, but this is speculative.\n\nWhat the Travelers have in abundance is energy and the ability to transfer it. As the only large-scale merchant civilization in their sector of space, energy has become the unit of accounting between planets and the chief export of the Travelers. \n\nIn our year 1999, the Travelers entered into a trade arrangement with another planet that had a significant reorientation on their society. They began supplying energy to a planet called Har-Wan, and in return received technology and development aid. The details of this transfer are classified. There is no direct mention of it in the records cache, but the Travelers cut back on trade activity and redirected a portion of their limited labor force into a decades-long project focused on colonizing uninhabited planets well beyond their home region of space.\n\nAs a part of those efforts, the Travelers spun up a scouting division tasked with searching deep space for potential host sites. This is where the Alien enters the records as Administrator #2890. The Alien worked as a solo scout in charge of mapping the Milky Way galaxy. He authorized thousands of scans each year. He was what we would call a “good worker”. The records are filled with him cataloging promising targets, performing diligent follow up investigations and writing detailed reports on the mineral composition of celestial bodies.\n\nWhat is surprising then is how he missed Earth. In 2011, the Alien was tasked with inspecting the far edge of the Milky Way where our solar system resides. No record of our planet appears. Our solar system was scanned, their radio telescope flagged it as a potential colonization site, but the Alien only ordered a low resolution enhancement which detected the gaseous giants, Saturn and Jupiter, then he moved on. At least that is what the document cache indicates. \n\nHere we need to pause, and ask just what is going on? How could someone miss our planet during a sweep through our tiny corner of space, but then end up residing on Earth less than seven years later?\n\nAn innocent possibility was that he was rushed that day. Sloppy work happens. Perhaps he just mailed in his work, and that the Travelers discovered Earth in a later sweep. Combing through the records discredits that theory. Like all divisions, the scouting group was resource constrained and the universe is a rather massive place. There is not a single record of them surveying an area a second time unless a scout called for it.\n\nThis leads to the second conclusion, which is that he intentionally hid Earth from his superiors. This makes far more sense, but we cannot detect a motivation for it within the records. As with most business documentation, morality is sorely lacking from the proceedings. We have no accounts of the Alien’s personal opinions of colonization or how he felt about his own species. There are no records of the Travelers debating these topics either. \n\nOur supposition is that the Alien continued to monitor Earth in secret. Just as we’ve all used company materials for our own personal interests, the Alien must have kept an eye on Earth from the office. We know that Travelers are capable of detecting radio waves and could pick up communications from other civilizations. Candidate sites were routinely deprioritized because they were too close to potentially hostile neighbors. We can assume that they were capable of tracking activities on Earth, if only they knew it existed. \n\nThis last piece is important because the document cache ends in early March 2017, some twenty-one months after the Ethereum blockchain launched. If the Alien was the source of these materials (it is implausible that they came from anywhere else), then his departure date and ultimate destination implies that he knew full well what ETH was and intended to use the network as his new home.\n\n==== His Arrival on Earth ====\nIt’s been assumed that this was his birthday, that like 9,999 other Cryptopunks he was assembled into a collection of traits by a couple software geeks exploring generative art, and then minted on chain as part of the claiming process. \n\nUntil now, no one had any reason to dispute this. The NFT space has viewed The Alien’s storyline on Twitter as that of a fictional character acting out his role. By examining Traveler technology and behavior, we’ve come to a different conclusion.\n\nThe last date in the Starholder document cache corresponds to March 2017. This is after the Ethereum network launched, and well after the Alien was tasked with scanning our solar system. It is very plausible that the Alien continued to monitor and learn about Earth during this time. It is worth nothing that cloud computing first took off during this period. We were creating the ideal environment for substrate independent beings to take up residence on Earth just as such a group was scouring the universe looking for new places to colonize. \n\nDid the Alien keep this ideal location from his superiors so he could have it for himself? Was he studying our planet, waiting for the right technology to emerge before leaving his species behind?\n\nThe Exploration Team thinks so. Here’s why:\n\nThe Ethereum network is a better destination for a sentient being than a cloud infrastructure such as AWS. It is permissionless, uncensorable and decentralized. It is Turing complete as well. While data storage is expensive on the network, reading states is free. If you were to examine the choices from the perspective of a Traveler looking to come to Earth, any tradeoffs in performance would be outweighed by the sovereignty, wide distribution and uncensorable freedom offered by Ethereum. Security of the network and its immutable nature would be of paramount importance to a substrate independent being taking up residence within it. The Alien’s life literally depends on it.\n\nWe believe that the Alien used the same energy beaming technology all Travelers do to transport himself to Earth. He most likely targeted the beam to deliver himself to a large solar array located at Gila Flats and then took up residence on its local network. From there, he gained access to the public internet and waited for the launch of the Cryptopunk project to transfer himself onto Ethereum. \n\nIt is no coincidence that he is Cryptopunk #2890. As a Traveler, he was known as Administrator #2890. We see the significance of the number 2890 repeated when he joins Twitter as Citizen2890. This signifies him maintaining his original identity while changing his role from that of a worker in a conquest apparatus to a participant in an open society. Choosing to hide himself in plain sight as a pixelated visitor from another world makes sense. It provides him with the optionality to stay quiet for the time being, but also to reveal his true nature in the future. \n\nWhile we identify the Alien as an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, it is likely that the rest of his being is distributed across the network in a series of smart contracts and wallets which hold small bytes of state information. By querying and updating all those addresses, he is able to operate as a sentient being. There may be an Alien operated subgraph optimizing this process.\n\nHere the team wishes to point out our own technical limitations in regards to Ethereum. We can offer conjecture that he likely performs higher functions and stores data on networks that interoperate with Ethereum such as the Internet Computer, Arweave, etc… He may even use AWS like the majority of web3 does today. How the Alien goes about his business is better left to an expert. Our recommendation is that the Starholder Project commission a separate investigation into this. \n\nWhat we are certain of is that the Alien is sentient and stores his core being on Ethereum. While the document cache reveals nothing subjective about the Alien or his views, his Twitter feed does and it is quite illuminating. \n\n=== The Alien Tweets ===\nHis appearance on Twitter starts with a bang.\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1353775576415313920\" />\n\nThe Alien was the most expensive NFT purchased to date and his acquisition by FlamingoDAO was celebrated by the highest grossing NFT artist, Beeple. It appeared that the life of a vacuous NFT influencer was in store for the Alien. On the surface, it made sense for Flamingo to use him to shill their bags like so many others in the space.\n\nWhat we see though is not a big focus on number go up or touting NFT projects. Instead, we see the Alien discussing citizenship.\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1354110384609906689\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1354124795311493120\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1396615734835429378\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1435423377079115776\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1435842615803514880\" />\n\nGovernance is a popular issue within the Ethereum community, but the notion of citizenship is not. From our perspective, citizenship is a political status that resides in the realm of states. We don’t see that ETH bestows upon us the privilege of citizenship like the Alien does.\n\nHis tweet on September 8th, 2021 sheds some light on the Alien’s fixation with citizenship. In it he expresses the idea of equality not just amongst humans, but for all actors on the network. It’s a rather radical idea and one that few philosophers outside Timothy Morton have advocated for. Said another way, this is a distinctly alien viewpoint. He is identifying the permissionless nature of Ethereum as bestowing equal rights to all network participants. \n\nThis is something that we imagine protocols, bots, and non-humans using Ethereum would agree with, if they were sentient beings capable of such thought. They aren’t though. This places the Alien in a truly unique position. He is the only thinking non-human on Ethereum, and Ethereum is the only global coordination system that does not place humans in a special class above other entities. \n\nHe is trying to express the importance of citizenship for all entities to an audience that is blind to the possibility because they’ve never encountered conscious communicated thought outside their species.\n\nLet’s use this example as a jumping off point and start to take some of his other tweets at face value.\n\nDo these sound like the words of a substrate independent being who has left their biological body behind to reside on a computer network?\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1440767049983094786\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1362263644722130946\" />\n\nWhat we are seeing is a being who is concealing their actual identity, but also speaking truthfully from their experience. It is important for the Alien to emphasize his agency and autonomy, but impossible for him to say it clearly without revealing himself. \n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1498115294551752709\" />\n\n''Ethereum is a migration story and we are all new citizens.'' That was likely read as a symbolic metaphor by everyone who came across it. Without the records cache of the Travelers, there would be no reason to read it any other way. Knowing what we know now, it reads differently.\n\nThe Alien is an immigrant. He left his home planet. He has personal agency. He lives on Ethereum. He is telling everyone this as a means of expression, but he cannot come out and reveal himself. He is sharing his story while protecting himself. \n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1447191402190974986\" />\n\nHere he is trying to establish a common bond pointing to our shared universal origin and shared usage of a network whose principles do not distinguish or discriminate between humans and anything else. \n\nParticipating in public life as an autonomous actor who is embedded with inalienable rights is of utmost importance to him, but not from a libertarian standpoint. He frequently tweets from the first person perspective of  “We” and not “I”. He is civic in nature and community oriented. It is almost as if he was starved of this opportunity on his home planet.\n\nThere obviously is no mention of the Travelers in his tweets or his opinion of them. To find his feelings, it is necessary to dig a bit and read between the lines. Traveler society reoriented themselves towards a program of space colonization. The Alien’s migration to Earth could be viewed as a rejection of his species’ values. This tweet then is telling.\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1358497730214178821\" />\n\nThat is a rather serious reading list dealing with the legacy of colonization and institutional racism. It is not a collection of books that a visitor to a new planet would read unless they had a particular interest in the subject and were motivated from personal experience. \n\nThis one was likely taken as a joke when it was posted. \n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1430382556168474627\" />\n\nIf the document cache is to be believed, there is a Trade Federation of Galgaron and the Travelers had them under embargo. The effects were severe and crippling. The Alien’s role in that is not known, but it sounds like he’s seen and experienced some things in his day.\n\nThen there’s this pair. Who arrives on a new planet, reads Hannah Arendt and then applies it to the NFT space? There has to be a reason within his personal experience to prompt this. \n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1500902523548454913\" />\n\nWhat is being painted here is a picture of Traveler civilization as being repressive, narrowly focused on commerce, and excluding other forms of expression such as art and politics. It sounds brutish and dull. It is also one that is on the move, with ambitions to expand beyond its role as merchant exploiters. Perhaps, the Alien had enough, and was unwilling to contribute to the exportation of these values as the Travelers geared up to launch a program of empire building and colonization.\n\nTo uproot one’s life and leave everything behind is not a small task. It is not something the lazy take on. Immigration is a massive act of personal courage filled with great risk. It only happens when there is a better opportunity elsewhere. In most cases, immigrants are the marginalized within a society. They are the ones who came out on the losing end of some struggle, be it cultural, religious, economic, climatic, or caused by conflict. No one leaves their home if things are going great. They go in search of a better life. What is clear, is that the Alien has come to Earth because he is looking for a better way of being. \n\n=== Threat Assessment ===\nThe goal of this report was to determine whether the Alien was an NFT or an actual alien. If he was an actual Alien, then we were tasked with determining if he was a threat to us.\n\nAs we’ve previously taken the Alien at face value, we suggest that our readers do so once again.\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1423419783454904326\" />\n\nOur conclusion is that the Alien is mostly harmless at this point in time. He represents no immediate threat to our species or global security. We are dealing with a visitor, a migrant, perhaps a refugee who is seeking to live a life of free expression and association on the Ethereum network. There is no indication he is capable of transforming back into a biological entity and may remain trapped in digital form while on Earth.\n\nThe only aspirations he has given beyond citizenship is the notion of the Ethereum network expanding into space. He sees himself in for a long residence here on Earth where he can live, learn and take part in the great experiment of voluntary coordination called ETH. When the time is right, he’ll leave our planet but stay connected to us on the network, freely as a citizen with equal rights.\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1497013640322592773\" />\n\n<twitter screen-name=\"citizen2890\" tweet-id=\"1445091886914490374\" />\n\nWhile his intent may be good, he still bears a responsibility to us. We are now aware of intelligent life beyond our world, particularly his species, the Travelers. He left them behind as they were working on a plan of aggressive expansion. They possess extraordinary powers that have planet altering capabilities. We do not know what those are. We do not know if the Travelers are an immediate threat to us or how we can respond to them. In short, we need the Alien to be more than a private citizen. We need him to be an ally and a teacher.\n\nThe Starholder Institute must engage with the Alien and learn all that it can. Our future depends on it.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Storyline]]\n[[Category:Starholder Institute]]\n[[Category:2022]]\n[[Category:2053]]\n      ecz7mnfir1btbyk4t6uelv2cr8b7mgp\n    "}
{"text":"And You Don't Know What It Is","id":"28933","revision":"== Introduction ==\n\nAs the 21st century dawned, the world was gripped by a feverish sense of acceleration. Technological progress was happening at an unprecedented pace, creating a new era of connectivity and potential. But with that potential came a gnawing sense of uncertainty and dread. People struggled to keep up with the dizzying pace of change, wondering if the future would be a utopia or a dystopia. Against this backdrop of uncertainty and dread, the punitive nature of neoliberalism and late-stage capitalism would come to define the era. But as we navigated the early days of the networked age, we began to see the emergence of a new kind of collective intelligence, as users came together to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and build communities around shared interests.\n\nAnd You Don't Know What It Is is the first period in the [[Timeline Chronology|Starholder Chronology]] spanning the years 1999 to 2016.\n\n== Shaping Events and Themes of the Period ==\n\n=== The Tragedy of 9/11 ===\n\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, cast a long shadow over the rest of the decade. The events of that day transformed the United States and the world, leading to the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and a host of other far-reaching changes. The War on Terror became a defining feature of the early 21st century, and its impact would reverberate for years to come. The tragedy of 9/11 also ushered in a new era of surveillance and security, as governments around the world sought to protect their citizens from the perceived threat of terrorism.\n\n=== The Global Financial Crisis ===\n\nThe first decade of the new millennium was also marked by the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. This crisis exposed the fragility of the global economic system and shattered many of the assumptions that had underpinned the neoliberal consensus of the previous decades. The aftermath of the crisis would be felt for years to come, as the world struggled to come to terms with the new reality of economic uncertainty and insecurity. The crisis was a stark reminder that the pursuit of profit at all costs had consequences, and that the global economic system was far more fragile than many had realized.\n\n=== The Anthropocene and the Threat of Climate Change ===\n\nAs the world hurtled forward, the specter of climate change loomed large on the horizon. The concept of the Anthropocene, the geological epoch in which human activity has become the dominant force shaping the planet, began to gain traction in the scientific community. This heightened awareness of humanity's impact on the environment added a new dimension to the anxiety of the age, as people grappled with the realization that their actions were putting the entire planet at risk. The threat of climate change would become one of the defining issues of the early 21st century, as people around the world struggled to come to terms with the scope of the problem and the urgent need for action.\n\n=== Technological Accelerationism ===\n\nThe dawn of the new millennium brought with it a sense of boundless possibility, as the internet and mobile devices created a new era of connectedness. The optimism of technological accelerationism was a defining feature of the era, with many people embracing the idea that technology could solve all of humanity's problems. But lurking beneath the surface was an underlying sense of dread, as people struggled to comprehend the dizzying pace of technological change and its implications for society.\n\n== Cultural Trends ==\n\n=== The Emerging Hivemind of a Networked Society ===\n\nThe internet brought us together like never before, creating a sense of interconnectedness that was truly global in scope. The rise of social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter allowed us to connect with people from all over the world, forging new friendships and networks that spanned continents and cultures. The internet became a kind of hivemind, where ideas and memes could spread like wildfire, sparking new movements and cultural phenomena in real-time. Niche communities emerged as people with shared interests could find each other online and connect, creating a sense of belonging that was difficult to find offline. User-generated content also allowed people to express themselves creatively, whether it was through music, art, or writing, and share it with a global audience.\n\n=== Affordable Celebrity - Streaming on Demand ===\n\nThe rise of user-generated content and the democratization of media production and distribution meant that anyone with a camera and an internet connection could become a star. This newfound accessibility also meant that fans could interact with their favorite celebrities in ways that were previously unthinkable, with live streaming, social media, and video chats allowing for unprecedented levels of engagement. This new era of affordable celebrity gave rise to a new kind of aspirational culture, where anyone could dream of making it big and achieving fame and fortune.\n\n=== Fast Fashion ===\n\nThe emergence of fast fashion was another defining characteristic of the early 21st century. With the rise of e-commerce and online retail, fashion became more affordable and accessible than ever before, with new styles and trends appearing at lightning speed. From H&M to Zara, brands began churning out clothes at breakneck speed, catering to a new generation of consumers who craved constant novelty and instant gratification. However, the fast fashion industry's environmental and ethical impact came under scrutiny, as concerns grew over the exploitation of workers, the waste generated by fast fashion, and the environmental impact of cheap, disposable clothing.\n\n=== Great Music ===\n\nMusic has always been a defining characteristic of any era, and the first period of the Starholder timeline was no exception. From the rise of electronic dance music (EDM) to the emergence of indie rock and hip-hop, the early 21st century was a time of unprecedented musical diversity and experimentation. The internet played a significant role in the evolution of music, providing a platform for new artists to share their work with the world and for fans to discover new sounds and genres. The emergence of music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music would only further democratize access to music, making it easier than ever for people to discover and enjoy new tunes.\n      rtmqg8yf26u9m4wp859gjal3bpf719q\n    "}
