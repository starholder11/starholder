Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird Old Mister Empire never says a word It\u2019s hard times from the country Livin\u2019 down in New York town Well, it\u2019s up in the mornin\u2019 tryin\u2019 to find a job of work Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt If you got a lot o\u2019 money you can make yourself merry If you only got a nickel, it\u2019s the Staten Island Ferry And it\u2019s hard times in the city Livin\u2019 down in New York town Mister Hudson come a-sailin\u2019 down the stream And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream Bought your city on a one-way track \u2019F I had my way I\u2019d sell it right back And it\u2019s hard times in the city Livin\u2019 down in New York town I\u2019ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay \u2019N\u2019 every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains \u2019N\u2019 the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines It\u2019s all much cleaner than the New York kind And it\u2019s hard times in the city Livin\u2019 down in New York town So all you newsy people, spread the news around You c\u2019n listen to m\u2019 story, listen to m\u2019 song You c\u2019n step on my name, you c\u2019n try \u2019n\u2019 get me beat When I leave New York, I\u2019ll be standin\u2019 on my feet And it\u2019s hard times in the city Livin\u2019 down in New York town"}
